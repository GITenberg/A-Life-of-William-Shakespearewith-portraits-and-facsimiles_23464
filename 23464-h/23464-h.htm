v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>This work is based on the article on Shakespeare which I contributed
last year to the fifty-first volume of the &lsquo;Dictionary of National
Biography.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the changes and additions which the article has
undergone during my revision of it for separate publication are so numerous
as to give the book a title to be regarded as an independent venture.&nbsp;
In its general aims, however, the present life of Shakespeare endeavours
loyally to adhere to the principles that are inherent in the scheme of the
&lsquo;Dictionary of National Biography.&rsquo;&nbsp; I have endeavoured to
set before my readers a plain and practical narrative of the great
dramatist&rsquo;s personal history as concisely as the needs of clearness
and completeness would permit.&nbsp; I have sought to provide students of
Shakespeare with a full record of the duly attested facts and dates of
their master&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; I have avoided merely &aelig;sthetic
criticism.&nbsp; My estimates of the value of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays and
poems are intended solely to fulfil the obligation that lies on the
biographer of indicating <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>succinctly the character of the successive
labours which were woven into the texture of his hero&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
&AElig;sthetic studies of Shakespeare abound, and to increase their number
is a work of supererogation.&nbsp; But Shakespearean literature, as far as
it is known to me, still lacks a book that shall supply within a brief
compass an exhaustive and well-arranged statement of the facts of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s career, achievement, and reputation, that shall reduce
conjecture to the smallest dimensions consistent with coherence, and shall
give verifiable references to all the original sources of
information.&nbsp; After studying Elizabethan literature, history, and
bibliography for more than eighteen years, I believed that I might, without
exposing myself to a charge of presumption, attempt something in the way of
filling this gap, and that I might be able to supply, at least tentatively,
a guide-book to Shakespeare&rsquo;s life and work that should be, within
its limits, complete and trustworthy.&nbsp; How far my belief was justified
the readers of this volume will decide.</p>
<p>I cannot promise my readers any startling revelations.&nbsp; But my
researches have enabled me to remove some ambiguities which puzzled my
predecessors, and to throw light on one or two topics that have hitherto
obscured the course of Shakespeare&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; Particulars that
have not been before incorporated in Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography will be
found in my treatment of the following subjects: the conditions under which
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo; and the <!-- page vii--><a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>&lsquo;Merchant of
Venice&rsquo; were written; the references in Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays to
his native town and county; his father&rsquo;s applications to the
Heralds&rsquo; College for coat-armour; his relations with Ben Jonson and
the boy actors in 1601; the favour extended to his work by James I and his
Court; the circumstances which led to the publication of the First Folio,
and the history of the dramatist&rsquo;s portraits.&nbsp; I have somewhat
expanded the notices of Shakespeare&rsquo;s financial affairs which have
already appeared in the article in the &lsquo;Dictionary of National
Biography,&rsquo; and a few new facts will be found in my revised estimate
of the poet&rsquo;s pecuniary position.</p>
<p>In my treatment of the sonnets I have pursued what I believe to be an
original line of investigation.&nbsp; The strictly autobiographical
interpretation that critics have of late placed on these poems compelled
me, as Shakespeare&rsquo;s biographer, to submit them to a very narrow
scrutiny.&nbsp; My conclusion is adverse to the claim of the sonnets to
rank as autobiographical documents, but I have felt bound, out of respect
to writers from whose views I dissent, to give in detail the evidence on
which I base my judgment.&nbsp; Matthew Arnold sagaciously laid down the
maxim that &lsquo;the criticism which alone can much help us for the future
is a criticism which regards Europe as being, for intellectual and artistic
<a name="citationvii"></a><a href="#footnotevii" class="citation">[vii]</a>
purposes, one great confederation, <!-- page viii--><a
name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. viii</span>bound to a joint
action and working to a common result.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is criticism
inspired by this liberalising principle that is especially applicable to
the vast sonnet-literature which was produced by Shakespeare and his
contemporaries.&nbsp; It is criticism of the type that Arnold recommended
that can alone lead to any accurate and profitable conclusion respecting
the intention of the vast sonnet-literature of the Elizabethan era.&nbsp;
In accordance with Arnold&rsquo;s suggestion, I have studied
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets comparatively with those in vogue in England,
France, and Italy at the time he wrote.&nbsp; I have endeavoured to learn
the view that was taken of such literary endeavours by contemporary critics
and readers throughout Europe.&nbsp; My researches have covered a very
small portion of the wide field.&nbsp; But I have gone far enough, I think,
to justify the conviction that Shakespeare&rsquo;s collection of sonnets
has no reasonable title to be regarded as a personal or autobiographical
narrative.</p>
<p>In the Appendix (Sections III. and IV.) I have supplied a memoir of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s patron, the Earl of Southampton, and an account of the
Earl&rsquo;s relations with the contemporary world of letters.&nbsp; Apart
from Southampton&rsquo;s association with the sonnets, he promoted
Shakespeare&rsquo;s welfare at an early stage of the dramatist&rsquo;s
career, and I can quote the authority of Malone, who appended a sketch of
Southampton&rsquo;s history to his biography of Shakespeare (in the <!--
page ix--><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>&lsquo;Variorum&rsquo; edition of 1821), for treating a knowledge
of Southampton&rsquo;s life as essential to a full knowledge of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I have also printed in the Appendix a detailed
statement of the precise circumstances under which Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets were published by Thomas Thorpe in 1609 (Section V.), and a review
of the facts that seem to me to confute the popular theory that Shakespeare
was a friend and <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of William Herbert, third
Earl of Pembroke, who has been put forward quite unwarrantably as the hero
of the sonnets (Sections VI., VII., VIII.) <a name="citationix"></a><a
href="#footnoteix" class="citation">[ix]</a>&nbsp; I have also included in
the Appendix (Sections IX. and X.) a survey of the voluminous
sonnet-literature of the Elizabethan poets between 1591 and 1597, with
which Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnetteering efforts were very closely allied,
as well as a bibliographical note on a corresponding feature of French and
Italian literature between 1550 and 1600.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the article on Shakespeare in the
&lsquo;Dictionary of National Biography,&rsquo; I have received from
correspondents many criticisms and suggestions which have enabled me to
correct some errors.&nbsp; But a few of my correspondents have exhibited so
ingenuous a faith in those forged <!-- page x--><a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>documents relating to Shakespeare and forged
references to his works, which were promulgated chiefly by John Payne
Collier more than half a century ago, that I have attached a list of the
misleading records to my chapter on &lsquo;The Sources of Biographical
Information&rsquo; in the Appendix (Section I.)&nbsp; I believe the list to
be fuller than any to be met with elsewhere.</p>
<p>The six illustrations which appear in this volume have been chosen on
grounds of practical utility rather than of artistic merit.&nbsp; My
reasons for selecting as the frontispiece the newly discovered
&lsquo;Droeshout&rsquo; painting of Shakespeare (now in the Shakespeare
Memorial Gallery at Stratford-on-Avon) can be gathered from the history of
the painting and of its discovery which I give on pages 288-90.&nbsp; I
have to thank Mr. Edgar Flower and the other members of the Council of the
Shakespeare Memorial at Stratford for permission to reproduce the
picture.&nbsp; The portrait of Southampton in early life is now at Welbeck
Abbey, and the Duke of Portland not only permitted the portrait to be
engraved for this volume, but lent me the negative from which the plate has
been prepared.&nbsp; The Committee of the Garrick Club gave permission to
photograph the interesting bust of Shakespeare in their possession, <a
name="citationx"></a><a href="#footnotex" class="citation">[x]</a> but,
owing to the fact that it is moulded in black terra-cotta no satisfactory
negative could be obtained; the <!-- page xi--><a name="pagexi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xi</span>engraving I have used is from a photograph of a
white plaster cast of the original bust, now in the Memorial Gallery at
Stratford.&nbsp; The five autographs of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
signature&mdash;all that exist of unquestioned authenticity&mdash;appear in
the three remaining plates.&nbsp; The three signatures on the will have
been photographed from the original document at Somerset House, by
permission of Sir Francis Jenne, President of the Probate Court; the
autograph on the deed of purchase by Shakespeare in 1613 of the house in
Blackfriars has been photographed from the original document in the
Guildhall Library, by permission of the Library Committee of the City of
London; and the autograph on the deed of mortgage relating to the same
property, also dated in 1613, has been photographed from the original
document in the British Museum, by permission of the Trustees.&nbsp;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s coat-of-arms and motto, which are stamped on the cover
of this volume, are copied from the trickings in the margin of the
draft-grants of arms now in the Heralds&rsquo; College.</p>
<p>The Baroness Burdett-Coutts has kindly given me ample opportunities of
examining the two peculiarly interesting and valuable copies of the First
Folio <a name="citationxi"></a><a href="#footnotexi"
class="citation">[xi]</a> in her possession.&nbsp; Mr. Richard Savage, of
Stratford-on-Avon, the Secretary of the Birthplace Trustees, and Mr. W.
Salt Brassington, the Librarian of the Shakespeare Memorial at Stratford,
have courteously replied <!-- page xii--><a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>to the many inquiries that I have addressed to
them verbally or by letter.&nbsp; Mr. Lionel Cust, the Director of the
National Portrait Gallery, has helped me to estimate the authenticity of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s portraits.&nbsp; I have also benefited, while the work
has been passing through the press, by the valuable suggestions of my
friends the Rev. H. C. Beeching and Mr. W. J. Craig, and I have to thank
Mr. Thomas Seccombe for the zealous aid he has rendered me while correcting
the final proofs.</p>

1</span>I&mdash;PARENTAGE AND BIRTH</h2>
<h3>Distribution of the name.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare came of a family whose surname was borne through the middle
ages by residents in very many parts of England&mdash;at Penrith in
Cumberland, at Kirkland and Doncaster in Yorkshire, as well as in nearly
all the midland counties.&nbsp; The surname had originally a martial
significance, implying capacity in the wielding of the spear. <a
name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a" class="citation">[1a]</a>&nbsp;
Its first recorded holder is John Shakespeare, who in 1279 was living at
&lsquo;Freyndon,&rsquo; perhaps Frittenden, Kent. <a
name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b" class="citation">[1b]</a>&nbsp;
The great medi&aelig;val guild of St. Anne at Knowle, whose members
included the leading inhabitants of Warwickshire, was joined by many
Shakespeares in the fifteenth century. <a name="citation1c"></a><a
href="#footnote1c" class="citation">[1c]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 2--><a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>In the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the surname is found far more frequently in
Warwickshire than elsewhere.&nbsp; The archives of no less than twenty-four
towns and villages there contain notices of Shakespeare families in the
sixteenth century, and as many as thirty-four Warwickshire towns or
villages were inhabited by Shakespeare families in the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; Among them all William was a common Christian name.&nbsp; At
Rowington, twelve miles to the north of Stratford, and in the same hundred
of Barlichway, one of the most prolific Shakespeare families of
Warwickshire resided in the sixteenth century, and no less than three
Richard Shakespeares of Rowington, whose extant wills were proved
respectively in 1560, 1591, and 1614, were fathers of sons called
William.&nbsp; At least one other William Shakespeare was during the period
a resident in Rowington.&nbsp; As a consequence, the poet has been more
than once credited with achievements which rightly belong to one or other
of his numerous contemporaries who were identically named.</p>
<h3>The poet&rsquo;s ancestry.</h3>
<p>The poet&rsquo;s ancestry cannot be defined with absolute
certainty.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s father, when applying for a grant of arms
in 1596, claimed that his grandfather (the poet&rsquo;s great-grandfather)
received for services rendered in war a grant of land in Warwickshire from
Henry VII. <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a>&nbsp; No precise confirmation of this pretension
has been discovered, and it may be, after the manner of heraldic genealogy,
fictitious.&nbsp; But there is a probability that the poet <!-- page 3--><a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>came of good yeoman
stock, and that his ancestors to the fourth or fifth generation were fairly
substantial landowners. <a name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a>&nbsp; Adam Shakespeare, a tenant by military
service of land at Baddesley Clinton in 1389, seems to have been
great-grandfather of one Richard Shakespeare who held land at Wroxhall in
Warwickshire during the first thirty-four years (at least) of the sixteenth
century.&nbsp; Another Richard Shakespeare who is conjectured to have been
nearly akin to the Wroxhall family was settled as a farmer at Snitterfield,
a village four miles to the north of Stratford-on-Avon, in 1528. <a
name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b" class="citation">[3b]</a>&nbsp;
It is probable that he was the poet&rsquo;s grandfather.&nbsp; In 1550 he
was renting a messuage and land at Snitterfield of Robert Arden; he died at
the close of 1560, and on February 10 of the next year letters of
administration of his goods, chattels, and debts were issued to his son
John by the Probate Court at Worcester.&nbsp; His goods were valued at
&pound;35 17s. <a name="citation3c"></a><a href="#footnote3c"
class="citation">[3c]</a>&nbsp; Besides the son John, Richard of
Snitterfield certainly had a son Henry; while a Thomas Shakespeare, a
considerable landholder at <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Snitterfield between 1563 and 1583, whose
parentage is undetermined, may have been a third son.&nbsp; The son Henry
remained all his life at Snitterfield, where he engaged in farming with
gradually diminishing success; he died in embarrassed circumstances in
December 1596.&nbsp; John, the son who administered Richard&rsquo;s estate,
was in all likelihood the poet&rsquo;s father.</p>
<h3>The poet&rsquo;s father.</h3>
<p>About 1551 John Shakespeare left Snitterfield, which was his birthplace,
to seek a career in the neighbouring borough of Stratford-on-Avon.&nbsp;
There he soon set up as a trader in all manner of agricultural
produce.&nbsp; Corn, wool, malt, meat, skins, and leather were among the
commodities in which he dealt.&nbsp; Documents of a somewhat later date
often describe him as a glover.&nbsp; Aubrey, Shakespeare&rsquo;s first
biographer, reported the tradition that he was a butcher.&nbsp; But though
both designations doubtless indicated important branches of his business,
neither can be regarded as disclosing its full extent.&nbsp; The land which
his family farmed at Snitterfield supplied him with his varied
stock-in-trade.&nbsp; As long as his father lived he seems to have been a
frequent visitor to Snitterfield, and, like his father and brothers, he was
until the date of his father&rsquo;s death occasionally designated a farmer
or &lsquo;husbandman&rsquo; of that place.&nbsp; But it was with
Stratford-on-Avon that his life was mainly identified.</p>
<h3>His settlement at Stratford.</h3>
<p>In April 1552 he was living there in Henley Street, a thoroughfare
leading to the market town of Henley-in-Arden, and he is first mentioned in
the borough records as paying in that month a fine of <!-- page 5--><a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>twelve-pence for having a
dirt-heap in front of his house.&nbsp; His frequent appearances in the
years that follow as either plaintiff or defendant in suits heard in the
local court of record for the recovery of small debts suggest that he was a
keen man of business.&nbsp; In early life he prospered in trade, and in
October 1556 purchased two freehold tenements at Stratford&mdash;one, with
a garden, in Henley Street (it adjoins that now known as the poet&rsquo;s
birthplace), and the other in Greenhill Street with a garden and
croft.&nbsp; Thenceforth he played a prominent part in municipal
affairs.&nbsp; In 1557 he was elected an ale-taster, whose duty it was to
test the quality of malt liquors and bread.&nbsp; About the same time he
was elected a burgess or town councillor, and in September 1558, and again
on October 6, 1559, he was appointed one of the four petty constables by a
vote of the jury of the court-leet.&nbsp; Twice&mdash;in 1559 and
1561&mdash;he was chosen one of the affeerors&mdash;officers appointed to
determine the fines for those offences which were punishable arbitrarily,
and for which no express penalties were prescribed by statute.&nbsp; In
1561 he was elected one of the two chamberlains of the borough, an office
of responsibility which he held for two years.&nbsp; He delivered his
second statement of accounts to the corporation in January 1564.&nbsp; When
attesting documents he occasionally made his mark, but there is evidence in
the Stratford archives that he could write with facility; and he was
credited with financial aptitude.&nbsp; The municipal accounts, which were
checked by tallies and counters, were audited by him after he <!-- page
6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>ceased to be
chamberlain, and he more than once advanced small sums of money to the
corporation.</p>
<h3>The poet&rsquo;s mother.</h3>
<p>With characteristic shrewdness he chose a wife of assured
fortune&mdash;Mary, youngest daughter of Robert Arden, a wealthy farmer of
Wilmcote in the parish of Aston Cantlowe, near Stratford.&nbsp; The Arden
family in its chief branch, which was settled at Parkhall, Warwickshire,
ranked with the most influential of the county.&nbsp; Robert Arden, a
progenitor of that branch, was sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire
in 1438 (16 Hen. VI), and this sheriff&rsquo;s direct descendant, Edward
Arden, who was himself high sheriff of Warwickshire in 1575, was executed
in 1583 for alleged complicity in a Roman Catholic plot against the life of
Queen Elizabeth. <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; John Shakespeare&rsquo;s wife belonged to a
humbler branch of the family, and there is no trustworthy evidence to
determine the exact degree of kinship between the two branches.&nbsp; Her
grandfather, Thomas Arden, purchased in 1501 an estate at Snitterfield,
which passed, with other property, to her father Robert; John
Shakespeare&rsquo;s father, Richard, was one of this Robert Arden&rsquo;s
Snitterfield tenants.&nbsp; By his first wife, whose name is not known,
Robert Arden had seven daughters, of whom all but two married; John
Shakespeare&rsquo;s wife seems to have been the youngest.&nbsp; Robert
Arden&rsquo;s second wife, Agnes or Anne, widow of John Hill (<i>d.</i>
1545), a substantial farmer of Bearley, survived him; but by her he had no
issue.&nbsp; When he died at the end of 1556, he owned a farmhouse at
Wilmcote <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>and many acres, besides some hundred acres at Snitterfield, with
two farmhouses which he let out to tenants.&nbsp; The post-mortem inventory
of his goods, which was made on December 9, 1556, shows that he had lived
in comfort; his house was adorned by as many as eleven &lsquo;painted
cloths,&rsquo; which then did duty for tapestries among the middle
class.&nbsp; The exordium of his will, which was drawn up on November 24,
1556, and proved on December 16 following, indicates that he was an
observant Catholic.&nbsp; For his two youngest daughters, Alice and Mary,
he showed especial affection by nominating them his executors.&nbsp; Mary
received not only &pound;6. 13s. 4d. in money, but the fee-simple of
Asbies, his chief property at Wilmcote, consisting of a house with some
fifty acres of land.&nbsp; She also acquired, under an earlier settlement,
an interest in two messuages at Snitterfield. <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; But, although she was well
provided with worldly goods, she was apparently without education; several
extant documents bear her mark, and there is no proof that she could sign
her name.</p>
<h3>The poet&rsquo;s birth and baptism.</h3>
<p>John Shakespeare&rsquo;s marriage with Mary Arden doubtless took place
at Aston Cantlowe, the parish church of Wilmcote, in the autumn of 1557
(the church registers begin at a later date).&nbsp; On September 15, 1558,
his first child, a daughter, Joan, was baptised in the church of
Stratford.&nbsp; A second child, another daughter, Margaret, was baptised
on December 2, 1562; but both these children died in infancy.&nbsp; The
poet William, the first son and third child, was <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>born on April 22 or 23,
1564.&nbsp; The latter date is generally accepted as his birthday, mainly
(it would appear) on the ground that it was the day of his death.&nbsp;
There is no positive evidence on the subject, but the Stratford parish
registers attest that he was baptised on April 26.</p>
<h3>Alleged birthplace.</h3>
<p>Some doubt is justifiable as to the ordinarily accepted scene of his
birth.&nbsp; Of two adjoining houses forming a detached building on the
north side of Henley Street, that to the east was purchased by John
Shakespeare in 1556, but there is no evidence that he owned or occupied the
house to the west before 1575.&nbsp; Yet this western house has been known
since 1759 as the poet&rsquo;s birthplace, and a room on the first floor is
claimed as that in which he was born. <a name="citation8"></a><a
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; The two houses
subsequently came by bequest of the poet&rsquo;s granddaughter to the
family of the poet&rsquo;s sister, Joan Hart, and while the eastern
tenement was let out to strangers for more than two centuries, and by them
converted into an inn, the &lsquo;birthplace&rsquo; was until 1806 occupied
by the Harts, who latterly carried on there the trade of butcher.&nbsp; The
fact of its long occupancy by the poet&rsquo;s collateral descendants
accounts for the identification of the western rather than the eastern
tenement with his birthplace.&nbsp; Both houses were purchased in behalf of
subscribers to a public fund on September 16, 1847, and, after extensive
restoration, were converted into a single domicile for the purposes of a
public museum.&nbsp; They were presented under a deed of <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>trust to the corporation
of Stratford in 1866.&nbsp; Much of the Elizabethan timber and stonework
survives, but a cellar under the &lsquo;birthplace&rsquo; is the only
portion which remains as it was at the date of the poet&rsquo;s birth. <a

10</span>II&mdash;CHILDHOOD, EDUCATION, AND MARRIAGE</h2>
<h3>The father in municipal office.</h3>
<p>In July 1564, when William was three months old, the plague raged with
unwonted vehemence at Stratford, and his father liberally contributed to
the relief of its poverty-stricken victims.&nbsp; Fortune still favoured
him.&nbsp; On July 4, 1565, he reached the dignity of an alderman.&nbsp;
From 1567 onwards he was accorded in the corporation archives the
honourable prefix of &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo;&nbsp; At Michaelmas 1568 he attained
the highest office in the corporation gift, that of bailiff, and during his
year of office the corporation for the first time entertained actors at
Stratford.&nbsp; The Queen&rsquo;s Company and the Earl of
Worcester&rsquo;s Company each received from John Shakespeare an official
welcome. <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; On September 5, 1571, he was chief <!--
page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>alderman,
a post which he retained till September 30 the following year.&nbsp; In
1573 Alexander Webbe, the husband of his wife&rsquo;s sister Agnes, made
him overseer of his will; in 1575 he bought two houses in Stratford, one of
them doubtless the alleged birthplace in Henley Street; in 1576 he
contributed twelvepence to the beadle&rsquo;s salary.&nbsp; But after
Michaelmas 1572 he took a less active part in municipal affairs; he grew
irregular in his attendance at the council meetings, and signs were soon
apparent that his luck had turned.&nbsp; In 1578 he was unable to pay, with
his colleagues, either the sum of fourpence for the relief of the poor or
his contribution &lsquo;towards the furniture of three pikemen, two
bellmen, and one archer&rsquo; who were sent by the corporation to attend a
muster of the trained bands of the county.</p>
<h3>Brothers and sisters.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile his family was increasing.&nbsp; Four children besides the
poet&mdash;three sons, Gilbert (baptised October 13, 1566), Richard
(baptised March 11, 1574), and Edmund (baptised May 3, 1580), with a
daughter Joan (baptised April 15, 1569)&mdash;reached maturity.&nbsp; A
daughter Ann was baptised September 28, 1571, and was buried on April 4,
1579.&nbsp; To meet his growing liabilities, the father borrowed money from
his wife&rsquo;s kinsfolk, and he and his wife <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>mortgaged, on November
14, 1578, Asbies, her valuable property at Wilmcote, for &pound;40 to
Edmund Lambert of Barton-on-the-Heath, who had married her sister, Joan
Arden.&nbsp; Lambert was to receive no interest on his loan, but was to
take the &lsquo;rents and profits&rsquo; of the estate.&nbsp; Asbies was
thereby alienated for ever.&nbsp; Next year, on October 15, 1579, John and
his wife made over to Robert Webbe, doubtless a relative of Alexander
Webbe, for the sum apparently of &pound;40, his wife&rsquo;s property at
Snitterfield. <a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a></p>
<h3>The father&rsquo;s financial difficulties.</h3>
<p>John Shakespeare obviously chafed under the humiliation of having
parted, although as he hoped only temporarily, with his wife&rsquo;s
property of Asbies, and in the autumn of 1580 he offered to pay off the
mortgage; but his brother-in-law, Lambert, retorted that other sums were
owing, and he would accept all or none.&nbsp; The negotiation, which was
the beginning of much litigation, thus proved abortive.&nbsp; Through 1585
and 1586 a creditor, John Brown, was embarrassingly importunate, and, after
obtaining a writ of distraint, Brown informed the local court that the
debtor had no goods on which distraint could be levied. <a
name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a>&nbsp; On September 6, 1586, John was deprived of
his alderman&rsquo;s gown, on the ground of his long absence from the
council meetings. <a name="citation12c"></a><a href="#footnote12c"
class="citation">[12c]</a></p>
<h3><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>Education.</h3>
<p>Happily John Shakespeare was at no expense for the education of his four
sons.&nbsp; They were entitled to free tuition at the grammar school of
Stratford, which was reconstituted on a medi&aelig;val foundation by Edward
VI.&nbsp; The eldest son, William, probably entered the school in 1571,
when Walter Roche was master, and perhaps he knew something of Thomas Hunt,
who succeeded Roche in 1577.&nbsp; The instruction that he received was
mainly confined to the Latin language and literature.&nbsp; From the Latin
accidence, boys of the period, at schools of the type of that at Stratford,
were led, through conversation books like the &lsquo;Sententi&aelig;
Pueriles&rsquo; and Lily&rsquo;s grammar, to the perusal of such authors as
Seneca Terence, Cicero, Virgil, Plautus, Ovid, and Horace.&nbsp; The
eclogues of the popular renaissance poet, Mantuanus, were often preferred
to Virgil&rsquo;s for beginners.&nbsp; The rudiments of Greek were
occasionally taught in Elizabethan grammar schools to very promising
pupils; but such coincidences as have been detected between expressions in
Greek plays and in Shakespeare seem due to accident, and not to any study,
either at school or elsewhere, of the Athenian drama. <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Dr. Farmer enunciated in his &lsquo;Essay on Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Learning&rsquo; (1767) the theory that Shakespeare knew no language but his
own, and owed whatever knowledge he displayed of the classics and of
Italian and French literature to English translations.&nbsp; But several of
the books in French and Italian whence Shakespeare derived the plots of his
dramas&mdash;Belleforest&rsquo;s &lsquo;Histoires Tragiques,&rsquo; Ser
Giovanni&rsquo;s &lsquo;Il Pecorone,&rsquo; and Cinthio&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Hecatommithi,&rsquo; for example<!-- page 15--><a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>&mdash;were not
accessible to him in English translations; and on more general grounds the
theory of his ignorance is adequately confuted.&nbsp; A boy with
Shakespeare&rsquo;s exceptional alertness of intellect, during whose
schooldays a training in Latin classics lay within reach, could hardly lack
in future years all means of access to the literature of France and
Italy.</p>
<h3>The poet&rsquo;s classical equipment.</h3>
<p>With the Latin and French languages, indeed, and with many Latin poets
of the school curriculum, Shakespeare in his writings openly acknowledged
his acquaintance.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; the dialogue in many
scenes is carried on in French, which is grammatically accurate if not
idiomatic.&nbsp; In the mouth of his schoolmasters, Holofernes in
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo; and Sir Hugh Evans in
&lsquo;Merry Wives of Windsor,&rsquo; Shakespeare placed Latin phrases
drawn directly from Lily&rsquo;s grammar, from the &lsquo;Sententi&aelig;
Pueriles,&rsquo; and from &lsquo;the good old Mantuan.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
influence of Ovid, especially the &lsquo;Metamorphoses,&rsquo; was apparent
throughout his earliest literary work, both poetic and dramatic, and is
discernible in the &lsquo;Tempest,&rsquo; his latest play (v. i. 33
seq.)&nbsp; In the Bodleian Library there is a copy of the Aldine edition
of Ovid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Metamorphoses&rsquo; (1502), and on the title is the
signature W<sup>m</sup>. Sh<sup>e</sup>., which experts have
declared&mdash;not quite conclusively&mdash;to be a genuine autograph of
the poet. <a name="citation15"></a><a href="#footnote15"
class="citation">[15]</a>&nbsp; Ovid&rsquo;s Latin text was certainly not
unfamiliar to him, but his closest adaptations of Ovid&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Metamorphoses&rsquo; often reflect the phraseology of the popular
English version by <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Arthur Golding, of which some seven editions
were issued between 1565 and 1597.&nbsp; From Plautus Shakespeare drew the
plot of the &lsquo;Comedy of Errors,&rsquo; but it is just possible that
Plautus&rsquo;s comedies, too, were accessible in English.&nbsp;
Shakespeare had no title to rank as a classical scholar, and he did not
disdain a liberal use of translations.&nbsp; His lack of exact scholarship
fully accounts for the &lsquo;small Latin and less Greek&rsquo; with which
he was credited by his scholarly friend, Ben Jonson.&nbsp; But
Aubrey&rsquo;s report that &lsquo;he understood Latin pretty well&rsquo;
need not be contested, and his knowledge of French may be estimated to have
equalled his knowledge of Latin, while he doubtless possessed just
sufficient acquaintance with Italian to enable him to discern the drift of
an Italian poem or novel. <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<h3>Shakespeare and the Bible.</h3>
<p>Of the few English books accessible to him in his schooldays, the chief
was the English Bible, either in the popular Genevan version, first issued
in a complete form in 1560, or in the Bishops&rsquo; revision of 1568,
which the Authorised Version of 1611 closely followed.&nbsp; References to
scriptural characters and incidents are not conspicuous in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, but, such as they are, they are drawn from all
parts of the Bible, and indicate that general acquaintance with the
narrative of both Old and New Testaments which a clever boy would be
certain to acquire either in the schoolroom or at church on Sundays.&nbsp;
Shakespeare quotes or adapts <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>biblical phrases with far greater frequency
than he makes allusion to episodes in biblical history.&nbsp; But many such
phrases enjoyed proverbial currency, and others, which were more recondite,
were borrowed from Holinshed&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chronicles&rsquo; and secular
works whence he drew his plots.&nbsp; As a rule his use of scriptural
phraseology, as of scriptural history, suggests youthful reminiscence and
the assimilative tendency of the mind in a stage of early development
rather than close and continuous study of the Bible in adult life. <a
name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a></p>
<h3>Withdrawal from school.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare was a schoolboy in July 1575, when Queen Elizabeth made a
progress through Warwickshire on a visit to her favourite, the Earl of
Leicester, at his castle of Kenilworth.&nbsp; References have been detected
in Oberon&rsquo;s vision in Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo; (II. ii. 148-68) to the fantastic pageants and
masques with which the Queen during her stay was entertained in Kenilworth
Park.&nbsp; Leicester&rsquo;s residence was only fifteen miles from
Stratford, and it is possible that Shakespeare went thither with his father
to witness some of the open-air festivities; but two full descriptions
which were published in 1576, in pamphlet form, gave Shakespeare knowledge
of all that took place. <a name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s opportunities of
recreation outside Stratford were in any case restricted during his
schooldays.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s financial <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>difficulties grew
steadily, and they caused his removal from school at an unusually early
age.&nbsp; Probably in 1577, when he was thirteen, he was enlisted by his
father in an effort to restore his decaying fortunes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have
been told heretofore,&rsquo; wrote Aubrey, &lsquo;by some of the neighbours
that when he was a boy he exercised his father&rsquo;s trade,&rsquo; which,
according to the writer, was that of a butcher.&nbsp; It is possible that
John&rsquo;s ill-luck at the period compelled him to confine himself to
this occupation, which in happier days formed only one branch of his
business.&nbsp; His son may have been formally apprenticed to him.&nbsp; An
early Stratford tradition describes him as &lsquo;a butcher&rsquo;s
apprentice.&rsquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;When he kill&rsquo;d a calf,&rsquo;
Aubrey proceeds less convincingly, &lsquo;he would doe it in a high style
and make a speech.&nbsp; There was at that time another butcher&rsquo;s son
in this towne, that was held not at all inferior to him for a naturall
witt, his acquaintance, and coetanean, but dyed young.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>The poet&rsquo;s marriage.</h3>
<p>At the end of 1582 Shakespeare, when little more than eighteen and a
half years old, took a step which was little calculated to lighten his
father&rsquo;s anxieties.&nbsp; He married.&nbsp; His wife, according to
the inscription on her tombstone, was his senior by eight years.&nbsp; Rowe
states that she &lsquo;was the daughter of one Hathaway, said to have been
a substantial yeoman in the neighbourhood of Stratford.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Richard Hathaway of Shottery.&nbsp; Anne Hathaway.</h3>
<p>On September 1, 1581, Richard Hathaway, &lsquo;husbandman&rsquo; of
Shottery, a hamlet in the parish of Old <!-- page 19--><a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Stratford, made his
will, which was proved on July 9, 1582, and is now preserved at Somerset
House.&nbsp; His house and land, &lsquo;two and a half virgates,&rsquo; had
been long held in copyhold by his family, and he died in fairly prosperous
circumstances.&nbsp; His wife Joan, the chief legatee, was directed to
carry on the farm with the aid of her eldest son, Bartholomew, to whom a
share in its proceeds was assigned.&nbsp; Six other children&mdash;three
sons and three daughters&mdash;received sums of money; Agnes, the eldest
daughter, and Catherine, the second daughter, were each allotted &pound;6
13s. 4d, &lsquo;to be paid at the day of her marriage,&rsquo; a phrase
common in wills of the period.&nbsp; Anne and Agnes were in the sixteenth
century alternative spellings of the same Christian name; and there is
little doubt that the daughter &lsquo;Agnes&rsquo; of Richard
Hathaway&rsquo;s will became, within a few months of Richard
Hathaway&rsquo;s death, Shakespeare&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<h3>Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s cottage.</h3>
<p>The house at Shottery, now known as Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s cottage, and
reached from Stratford by field-paths, undoubtedly once formed part of
Richard Hathaway&rsquo;s farmhouse, and, despite numerous alterations and
renovations, still preserves many features of a thatched farmhouse of the
Elizabethan period.&nbsp; The house remained in the Hathaway family till
1838, although the male line became extinct in 1746.&nbsp; It was purchased
in behalf of the public by the Birthplace trustees in 1892.</p>
<h3>The bond against impediments.</h3>
<p>No record of the solemnisation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s marriage
survives.&nbsp; Although the parish of Stratford <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>included Shottery, and
thus both bride and bridegroom were parishioners, the Stratford parish
register is silent on the subject.&nbsp; A local tradition, which seems to
have come into being during the present century, assigns the ceremony to
the neighbouring hamlet or chapelry of Luddington, of which neither the
chapel nor parish registers now exist.&nbsp; But one important piece of
documentary evidence directly bearing on the poet&rsquo;s matrimonial
venture is accessible.&nbsp; In the registry of the bishop of the diocese
(Worcester) a deed is extant wherein Fulk Sandells and John Richardson,
&lsquo;husbandmen of Stratford,&rsquo; bound themselves in the
bishop&rsquo;s consistory court, on November 28, 1582, in a surety of
&pound;40, to free the bishop of all liability should a lawful
impediment&mdash;&lsquo;by reason of any precontract&rsquo; [<i>i.e.</i>
with a third party] or consanguinity&mdash;be subsequently disclosed to
imperil the validity of the marriage, then in contemplation, of William
Shakespeare with Anne Hathaway.&nbsp; On the assumption that no such
impediment was known to exist, and provided that Anne obtained the consent
of her &lsquo;friends,&rsquo; the marriage might proceed &lsquo;with once
asking of the bannes of matrimony betwene them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bonds of similar purport, although differing in significant details, are
extant in all diocesan registries of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; They were
obtainable on the payment of a fee to the bishop&rsquo;s commissary, and
had the effect of expediting the marriage ceremony while protecting the
clergy from the consequences of any possible breach of canonical law.&nbsp;
But they were not <!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>common, and it was rare for persons in the
comparatively humble position in life of Anne Hathaway and young
Shakespeare to adopt such cumbrous formalities when there was always
available the simpler, less expensive, and more leisurely method of
marriage by &lsquo;thrice asking of the banns.&rsquo;&nbsp; Moreover, the
wording of the bond which was drawn before Shakespeare&rsquo;s marriage
differs in important respects from that adopted in all other known
examples. <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21"
class="citation">[21]</a>&nbsp; In the latter it is invariably provided
that the marriage shall not take place without the consent of the parents
or governors of both bride and bridegroom.&nbsp; In the case of the
marriage of an &lsquo;infant&rsquo; bridegroom the formal consent of his
parents was absolutely essential to strictly regular procedure, although
clergymen might be found who were ready to shut their eyes to the facts of
the situation and to run the risk of solemnising the marriage of an
&lsquo;infant&rsquo; without inquiry as to the parents&rsquo;
consent.&nbsp; The clergyman who united Shakespeare in wedlock to Anne
Hathaway was obviously of this easy temper.&nbsp; Despite the circumstance
that Shakespeare&rsquo;s bride was of full age and he himself was by nearly
three years a minor, the Shakespeare bond stipulated merely for the consent
of the bride&rsquo;s &lsquo;friends,&rsquo; and ignored the
bridegroom&rsquo;s parents altogether.&nbsp; Nor was this the only
irregularity in the document.&nbsp; In other pre-matrimonial covenants <!--
page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of the
kind the name either of the bridegroom himself or of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
father figures as one of the two sureties, and is mentioned first of the
two.&nbsp; Had the usual form been followed, Shakespeare&rsquo;s father
would have been the chief party to the transaction in behalf of his
&lsquo;infant&rsquo; son.&nbsp; But in the Shakespeare bond the sole
sureties, Sandells and Richardson, were farmers of Shottery, the
bride&rsquo;s native place.&nbsp; Sandells was a &lsquo;supervisor&rsquo;
of the will of the bride&rsquo;s father, who there describes him as
&lsquo;my trustie friende and neighbour.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Birth of a daughter.</h3>
<p>The prominence of the Shottery husbandmen in the negotiations preceding
Shakespeare&rsquo;s marriage suggests the true position of affairs.&nbsp;
Sandells and Richardson, representing the lady&rsquo;s family, doubtless
secured the deed on their own initiative, so that Shakespeare might have
small opportunity of evading a step which his intimacy with their
friend&rsquo;s daughter had rendered essential to her reputation.&nbsp; The
wedding probably took place, without the consent of the bridegroom&rsquo;s
parents&mdash;it may be without their knowledge&mdash;soon after the
signing of the deed.&nbsp; Within six months&mdash;in May 1583&mdash;a
daughter was born to the poet, and was baptised in the name of Susanna at
Stratford parish church on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Formal betrothal probably dispensed with.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s apologists have endeavoured to show that the public
betrothal or formal &lsquo;troth-plight&rsquo; which was at the time a
common prelude to a wedding carried with it all the privileges of
marriage.&nbsp; But neither Shakespeare&rsquo;s detailed description of a
<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>betrothal <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23"
class="citation">[23]</a> nor of the solemn verbal contract that ordinarily
preceded marriage lends the contention much support.&nbsp; Moreover, the
whole circumstances of the case render it highly improbable that
Shakespeare and his bride submitted to the formal preliminaries of a
betrothal.&nbsp; In that ceremony the parents of both contracting parties
invariably played foremost parts, but the wording of the bond precludes the
assumption that the bridegroom&rsquo;s parents were actors in any scene of
the hurriedly planned drama of his marriage.</p>
<p>A difficulty has been imported into the narration of the poet&rsquo;s
matrimonial affairs by the assumption of his identity with one
&lsquo;William Shakespeare,&rsquo; to whom, according to an entry in the
Bishop of Worcester&rsquo;s register, a license was issued on November 27,
1582 (the day <i>before</i> the signing of the Hathaway bond), authorising
his marriage with Anne Whateley of Temple Grafton.&nbsp; The theory that
the maiden name of Shakespeare&rsquo;s wife was Whateley is quite
untenable, and it is unsafe to assume that the bishop&rsquo;s clerk, when
making a note of the grant of the license in his register, erred so
extensively as to write Anne <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Whateley of Temple Grafton&rsquo; for
&lsquo;Anne Hathaway of Shottery.&rsquo;&nbsp; The husband of Anne Whateley
cannot reasonably be identified with the poet.&nbsp; He was doubtless
another of the numerous William Shakespeares who abounded in the diocese of
Worcester.&nbsp; Had a license for the poet&rsquo;s marriage been secured
on November 27, <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a> it is unlikely that the Shottery husbandmen would
have entered next day into a bond &lsquo;against impediments,&rsquo; the
execution of which might well have been demanded as a preliminary to the
grant of a license but was wholly supererogatory after the grant was
made.</p>
<h2><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>III&mdash;THE FAREWELL TO STRATFORD</h2>
<p>Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s greater burden of years and the likelihood that
the poet was forced into marrying her by her friends were not circumstances
of happy augury.&nbsp; Although it is dangerous to read into
Shakespeare&rsquo;s dramatic utterances allusions to his personal
experience, the emphasis with which he insists that a woman should take in
marriage &lsquo;an elder than herself,&rsquo; <a name="citation25a"></a><a
href="#footnote25a" class="citation">[25a]</a> and that prenuptial intimacy
is productive of &lsquo;barren hate, sour-eyed disdain, and discord,&rsquo;
suggest a personal interpretation. <a name="citation25b"></a><a
href="#footnote25b" class="citation">[25b]</a>&nbsp; To both these
unpromising features was added, in the poet&rsquo;s case, the absence of a
means of livelihood, and his course of life in the <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>years that immediately
followed implies that he bore his domestic ties with impatience.&nbsp;
Early in 1585 twins were born to him, a son (Hamnet) and a daughter
(Judith); both were baptised on February 2.&nbsp; All the evidence points
to the conclusion, which the fact that he had no more children confirms,
that in the later months of the year (1585) he left Stratford, and that,
although he was never wholly estranged from his family, he saw little of
wife or children for eleven years.&nbsp; Between the winter of 1585 and the
autumn of 1596&mdash;an interval which synchronises with his first literary
triumphs&mdash;there is only one shadowy mention of his name in Stratford
records.&nbsp; In April 1587 there died Edmund Lambert, who held Asbies
under the mortgage of 1578, and a few months later Shakespeare&rsquo;s
name, as owner of a contingent interest, was joined to that of his father
and mother in a formal assent given to an abortive proposal to confer on
Edmund&rsquo;s son and heir, John Lambert, an absolute title to the estate
on condition of his cancelling the mortgage and paying &pound;20.&nbsp; But
the deed does not indicate that Shakespeare personally assisted at the
transaction. <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<h3>Poaching at Charlecote.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s early literary work proves that while in the country
he eagerly studied birds, flowers, and trees, and gained a detailed
knowledge of horses and dogs.&nbsp; All his kinsfolk were farmers, and with
them he doubtless as a youth practised many field sports.&nbsp; Sympathetic
references to hawking, hunting, coursing, and angling abound in his early
plays and <!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>poems. <a name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a>&nbsp; And his sporting experiences passed at
times beyond orthodox limits.&nbsp; A poaching adventure, according to a
credible tradition, was the immediate cause of his long severance from his
native place.&nbsp; &lsquo;He had,&rsquo; wrote Rowe in 1709, &lsquo;by a
misfortune common enough to young fellows, fallen into ill company, and,
among them, some, that made a frequent practice of deer-stealing, engaged
him with them more than once in robbing a park that belonged to Sir Thomas
Lucy of Charlecote near Stratford.&nbsp; For this he was prosecuted by that
gentleman, as he thought, somewhat too severely; and, in order to revenge
that ill-usage, he made a ballad upon him, and though this, probably the
first essay of his poetry, be lost, yet it is said to have been so very
bitter that it redoubled the prosecution against him to that degree that he
was obliged to leave his business and family in Warwickshire and shelter
himself in London.&rsquo;&nbsp; The independent testimony of Archdeacon
Davies, who was vicar of Saperton, Gloucestershire, late in the seventeenth
century, is to the effect that Shakespeare &lsquo;was much given to all
unluckiness in stealing venison and rabbits, particularly from Sir Thomas
Lucy, who had him oft whipt, and sometimes imprisoned, and at last made him
fly his native county to his great advancement.&rsquo;&nbsp; The law of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s day (5 Eliz. cap. 21) <!-- page 28--><a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>punished deer-stealers
with three months&rsquo; imprisonment and the payment of thrice the amount
of the damage done.</p>
<h3>Unwarranted doubts of the tradition.</h3>
<p>The tradition has been challenged on the ground that the Charlecote
deer-park was of later date than the sixteenth century.&nbsp; But Sir
Thomas Lucy was an extensive game-preserver, and owned at Charlecote a
warren in which a few harts or does doubtless found an occasional
home.&nbsp; Samuel Ireland was informed in 1794 that Shakespeare stole the
deer, not from Charlecote, but from Fulbroke Park, a few miles off, and
Ireland supplied in his &lsquo;Views on the Warwickshire Avon,&rsquo; 1795,
an engraving of an old farmhouse in the hamlet of Fulbroke, where he
asserted that Shakespeare was temporarily imprisoned after his
arrest.&nbsp; An adjoining hovel was locally known for some years as
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;deer-barn,&rsquo; but no portion of Fulbroke
Park, which included the site of these buildings (now removed), was
Lucy&rsquo;s property in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and the amended legend,
which was solemnly confided to Sir Walter Scott in 1828 by the owner of
Charlecote, seems pure invention. <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<h3>Justice Shallow</h3>
<p>The ballad which Shakespeare is reported to have fastened on the park
gates of Charlecote does not, as Rowe acknowledged, survive.&nbsp; No
authenticity can be allowed the worthless lines beginning &lsquo;A
parliament member, a justice of peace,&rsquo; which were <!-- page 29--><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>represented to be
Shakespeare&rsquo;s on the authority of an old man who lived near Stratford
and died in 1703.&nbsp; But such an incident as the tradition reveals has
left a distinct impress on Shakespearean drama.&nbsp; Justice Shallow is
beyond doubt a reminiscence of the owner of Charlecote.&nbsp; According to
Archdeacon Davies of Saperton, Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;revenge was so
great that&rsquo; he caricatured Lucy as &lsquo;Justice Clodpate,&rsquo;
who was (Davies adds) represented on the stage as &lsquo;a great
man,&rsquo; and as bearing, in allusion to Lucy&rsquo;s name, &lsquo;three
louses rampant for his arms.&rsquo;&nbsp; Justice Shallow, Davies&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Justice Clodpate,&rsquo; came to birth in the &lsquo;Second Part of
Henry IV&rsquo; (1598), and he is represented in the opening scene of the
&lsquo;Merry Wives of Windsor&rsquo; as having come from Gloucestershire to
Windsor to make a Star-Chamber matter of a poaching raid on his
estate.&nbsp; The &lsquo;three luces hauriant argent&rsquo; were the arms
borne by the Charlecote Lucys, and the dramatist&rsquo;s prolonged
reference in this scene to the &lsquo;dozen white luces&rsquo; on Justice
Shallow&rsquo;s &lsquo;old coat&rsquo; fully establishes Shallow&rsquo;s
identity with Lucy.</p>
<h3>The flight from Stratford.</h3>
<p>The poaching episode is best assigned to 1585, but it may be questioned
whether Shakespeare, on fleeing from Lucy&rsquo;s persecution, at once
sought an asylum in London.&nbsp; William Beeston, a seventeenth-century
actor, remembered hearing that he had been for a time a country
schoolmaster &lsquo;in his younger years,&rsquo; and it seems possible that
on first leaving Stratford he found some such employment in a neighbouring
village.&nbsp; The <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>suggestion that he joined, at the end of 1585,
a band of youths of the district in serving in the Low Countries under the
Earl of Leicester, whose castle of Kenilworth was within easy reach of
Stratford, is based on an obvious confusion between him and others of his
name. <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; The knowledge of a soldier&rsquo;s life
which Shakespeare exhibited in his plays is no greater and no less than
that which he displayed of almost all other spheres of human activity, and
to assume that he wrote of all or of any from practical experience, unless
the evidence be conclusive, is to underrate his intuitive power of
realising life under almost every aspect by force of his imagination.</p>

31</span>IV&mdash;ON THE LONDON STAGE</h2>
<h3>The journey to London.</h3>
<p>To London Shakespeare naturally drifted, doubtless trudging thither on
foot during 1586, by way of Oxford and High Wycombe. <a
name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a>&nbsp; Tradition points to that as
Shakespeare&rsquo;s favoured route, rather than to the road by Banbury and
Aylesbury.&nbsp; Aubrey asserts that at Grendon near Oxford, &lsquo;he
happened to take the humour of the constable in &ldquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;by which he meant, we may suppose,
&lsquo;Much Ado about Nothing&rsquo;&mdash;but there were watchmen of the
Dogberry type all over England, and probably at Stratford itself.&nbsp; The
Crown Inn, (formerly 3 Cornmarket Street) near Carfax, at Oxford, was long
pointed out as one of his resting-places.</p>
<h3>Richard Field, his townsman.</h3>
<p>To only one resident in London is Shakespeare likely to have been known
previously. <a name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a>&nbsp; Richard <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>Field, a native of
Stratford, and son of a friend of Shakespeare&rsquo;s father, had left
Stratford in 1579 to serve an apprenticeship with Thomas Vautrollier, the
London printer.&nbsp; Shakespeare and Field, who was made free of the
Stationers&rsquo; Company in 1587, were soon associated as author and
publisher; but the theory that Field found work for Shakespeare in
Vautrollier&rsquo;s printing-office is fanciful. <a
name="citation32a"></a><a href="#footnote32a"
class="citation">[32a]</a>&nbsp; No more can be said for the attempt to
prove that he obtained employment as a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk.&nbsp; In view
of his general quickness of apprehension, Shakespeare&rsquo;s accurate use
of legal terms, which deserves all the attention that has been paid it, may
be attributable in part to his observation of the many legal processes in
which his father was involved, and in part to early intercourse with
members of the Inns of Court. <a name="citation32b"></a><a
href="#footnote32b" class="citation">[32b]</a></p>
<h3>Theatrical employment.</h3>
<p>Tradition and common-sense alike point to one of the only two theatres
(The Theatre or The Curtain) that existed in London at the date of his
arrival as an early scene of his regular occupation.&nbsp; The compiler of
&lsquo;Lives of the Poets&rsquo; (1753) <a name="citation32c"></a><a
href="#footnote32c" class="citation">[32c]</a> was the first to relate the
story that <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>his original connection with the playhouse was as holder of the
horses of visitors outside the doors.&nbsp; According to the same compiler,
the story was related by D&rsquo;Avenant to Betterton; but Rowe, to whom
Betterton communicated it, made no use of it.&nbsp; The two regular
theatres of the time were both reached on horseback by men of fashion, and
the owner of The Theatre, James Burbage, kept a livery stable at
Smithfield.&nbsp; There is no inherent improbability in the tale.&nbsp; Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s amplified version, in which Shakespeare was represented as
organising a service of boys for the purpose of tending visitors&rsquo;
horses, sounds apocryphal.</p>
<h3>A playhouse servitor.</h3>
<p>There is every indication that Shakespeare was speedily offered
employment inside the playhouse.&nbsp; In 1587 the two chief companies of
actors, claiming respectively the nominal patronage of the Queen and Lord
Leicester, returned to London from a provincial tour, during which they
visited Stratford.&nbsp; Two subordinate companies, one of which claimed
the patronage of the Earl of Essex and the other that of Lord Stafford,
also performed in the town during the same year.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
friends may have called the attention of the strolling players to the
homeless youth, rumours of whose search for employment about the London
theatres had doubtless reached Stratford.&nbsp; From such incidents seems
to have sprung the opportunity which offered Shakespeare fame and
fortune.&nbsp; According to Rowe&rsquo;s vague statement, &lsquo;he was
received into the company then in being at first in a very mean
rank.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>William Castle, the parish clerk of Stratford
at the end of the seventeenth century, was in the habit of telling visitors
that he entered the playhouse as a servitor.&nbsp; Malone recorded in 1780
a stage tradition &lsquo;that his first office in the theatre was that of
prompter&rsquo;s attendant&rsquo; or call-boy.&nbsp; His intellectual
capacity and the amiability with which he turned to account his versatile
powers were probably soon recognised, and thenceforth his promotion was
assured.</p>
<h3>The acting companies.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s earliest reputation was made as an actor, and,
although his work as a dramatist soon eclipsed his histrionic fame, he
remained a prominent member of the actor&rsquo;s profession till near the
end of his life.&nbsp; By an Act of Parliament of 1571 (14 Eliz. cap. 2),
which was re-enacted in 1596 (39 Eliz. cap. 4), players were under the
necessity of procuring a license to pursue their calling from a peer of the
realm or &lsquo;personage of higher degree;&rsquo; otherwise they were
adjudged to be of the status of rogues and vagabonds.&nbsp; The Queen
herself and many Elizabethan peers were liberal in the exercise of their
licensing powers, and few actors failed to secure a statutory license,
which gave them a rank of respectability, and relieved them of all risk of
identification with vagrants or &lsquo;sturdy beggars.&rsquo;&nbsp; From an
early period in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign licensed actors were organised into
permanent companies.&nbsp; In 1587 and following years, besides three
companies of duly licensed boy-actors that were formed from the choristers
of St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral and the Chapel <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Royal and from
Westminster scholars, there were in London at least six companies of fully
licensed adult actors; five of these were called after the noblemen to whom
their members respectively owed their licenses (viz. the Earls of
Leicester, Oxford, Sussex, and Worcester, and the Lord Admiral, Charles,
lord Howard of Effingham), and one of them whose actors derived their
license from the Queen was called the Queen&rsquo;s Company.</p>
<h3>The Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s company.</h3>
<p>The patron&rsquo;s functions in relation to the companies seem to have
been mainly confined to the grant or renewal of the actors&rsquo;
licenses.&nbsp; Constant alterations of name, owing to the death or change
from other causes of the patrons, render it difficult to trace with
certainty each company&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; But there seems no doubt that
the most influential of the companies named&mdash;that under the nominal
patronage of the Earl of Leicester&mdash;passed on his death in September
1588 to the patronage of Ferdinando Stanley, lord Strange, who became Earl
of Derby on September 25, 1592.&nbsp; When the Earl of Derby died on April
16, 1594, his place as patron and licenser was successively filled by Henry
Carey, first lord Hunsdon, Lord Chamberlain (<i>d.</i> July 23, 1596), and
by his son and heir, George Carey, second lord Hunsdon, who himself became
Lord Chamberlain in March 1597.&nbsp; After King James&rsquo;s succession
in May 1603 the company was promoted to be the King&rsquo;s players, and,
thus advanced in dignity, it fully maintained the supremacy <!-- page
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>which, under
its successive titles, it had already long enjoyed.</p>
<h3>A member of the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s.</h3>
<p>It is fair to infer that this was the company that Shakespeare
originally joined and adhered to through life.&nbsp; Documentary evidence
proves that he was a member of it in December 1594; in May, 1603 he was one
of its leaders.&nbsp; Four of its chief members&mdash;Richard Burbage, the
greatest tragic actor of the day, John Heming, Henry Condell, and Augustine
Phillips were among Shakespeare&rsquo;s lifelong friends.&nbsp; Under this
company&rsquo;s auspices, moreover, Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays first saw the
light.&nbsp; Only two of the plays claimed for him&mdash;&lsquo;Titus
Andronicus&rsquo; and &lsquo;3 Henry VI&rsquo;&mdash;seem to have been
performed by other companies (the Earl of Sussex&rsquo;s men in the one
case, and the Earl of Pembroke&rsquo;s in the other).</p>
<h3>The London theatres.</h3>
<p>When Shakespeare became a member of the company it was doubtless
performing at The Theatre, the playhouse in Shoreditch which James Burbage,
the father of the great actor, Richard Burbage, had constructed in 1576; it
abutted on the Finsbury Fields, and stood outside the City&rsquo;s
boundaries.&nbsp; The only other London playhouse then in
existence&mdash;the Curtain in Moorfields&mdash;was near at hand; its name
survives in Curtain Road, Shoreditch.&nbsp; But at an early date in his
acting career Shakespeare&rsquo;s company sought and found new
quarters.&nbsp; While known as Lord Strange&rsquo;s men, they opened on
February 19, 1592, a third London theatre, called the Rose, which Philip
Henslowe, the speculative <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>theatrical manager, had erected on the
Bankside, Southwark.&nbsp; At the date of the inauguration of the Rose
Theatre Shakespeare&rsquo;s company was temporarily allied with another
company, the Admiral&rsquo;s men, who numbered the great actor Edward
Alleyn among them.&nbsp; Alleyn for a few months undertook the direction of
the amalgamated companies, but they quickly parted, and no further
opportunity was offered Shakespeare of enjoying professional relations with
Alleyn.&nbsp; The Rose Theatre was doubtless the earliest scene of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s pronounced successes alike as actor and
dramatist.&nbsp; Subsequently for a short time in 1594 he frequented the
stage of another new theatre at Newington Butts, and between 1595 and 1599
the older stages of the Curtain and of The Theatre in Shoreditch.&nbsp; The
Curtain remained open till the Civil Wars, although its vogue after 1600
was eclipsed by that of younger rivals.&nbsp; In 1599 Richard Burbage and
his brother Cuthbert demolished the old building of The Theatre and built,
mainly out of the materials of the dismantled fabric, the famous theatre
called the Globe on the Bankside.&nbsp; It was octagonal in shape, and
built of wood, and doubtless Shakespeare described it (rather than the
Curtain) as &lsquo;this wooden O&rsquo; in the opening chorus of
&lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; (1. 13).&nbsp; After 1599 the Globe was mainly
occupied by Shakespeare&rsquo;s company, and in its profits he acquired an
important share.&nbsp; From the date of its inauguration until the
poet&rsquo;s retirement, the Globe&mdash;which quickly won the first place
among London theatres&mdash;seems to have been the sole playhouse with <!--
page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>which
Shakespeare was professionally associated.&nbsp; The equally familiar
Blackfriars Theatre, which was created out of a dwelling-house by James
Burbage, the actor&rsquo;s father, at the end of 1596, was for many years
afterwards leased out to the company of boy-actors known as &lsquo;the
Queen&rsquo;s Children of the Chapel;&rsquo; it was not occupied by
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company until December 1609 or January 1610, when his
acting days were nearing their end. <a name="citation38a"></a><a
href="#footnote38a" class="citation">[38a]</a></p>
<h3>Place of residence in London.</h3>
<p>In London Shakespeare resided near the theatres.&nbsp; According to a
memorandum by Alleyn (which Malone quoted), he lodged in 1596 near
&lsquo;the Bear Garden in Southwark.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1598 one William
Shakespeare, who was assessed by the collectors of a subsidy in the sum of
13s. 4d. upon goods valued at &pound;5, was a resident in St. Helen&rsquo;s
parish, Bishopsgate, but it is not certain that this taxpayer was the
dramatist. <a name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b"
class="citation">[38b]</a></p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s alleged travels.&nbsp; In Scotland.</h3>
<p>The chief differences between the methods of theatrical representation
in Shakespeare&rsquo;s day and our own lay in the fact that neither scenery
nor scenic costume nor women-actors were known to the Elizabethan
stage.&nbsp; All female <i>r&ocirc;les</i> were, until the Restoration in
1660, assumed in the public theatres by men or boys. <a
name="citation38c"></a><a href="#footnote38c"
class="citation">[38c]</a>&nbsp; Consequently the skill needed to rouse in
the audience the requisite illusions <!-- page 39--><a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>was far greater then
than at later periods.&nbsp; But the professional customs of Elizabethan
actors approximated in other respects more closely to those of their modern
successors than is usually recognised.&nbsp; The practice of touring in the
provinces was followed with even greater regularity then than now.&nbsp;
Few companies <!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>remained in London during the summer or early autumn, and every
country town with two thousand or more inhabitants could reckon on at least
one visit from travelling actors between May and October.&nbsp; A rapid
examination of the extant archives of some seventy municipalities selected
at random shows that Shakespeare&rsquo;s company between 1594 and 1614
frequently performed in such towns as Barnstaple, Bath, Bristol, Coventry,
Dover, Faversham, Folkestone, Hythe, Leicester, Maidstone, Marlborough, New
Romney, Oxford, Rye in Sussex, Saffron Walden, and Shrewsbury. <a
name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare may be credited with
faithfully fulfilling all his professional functions, and some of the
references to travel in his sonnets were doubtless reminiscences of early
acting tours.&nbsp; It has been repeatedly urged, moreover, that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company visited Scotland, and that he went with it. <a
name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a>&nbsp; In November 1599 <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>English actors arrived
in Scotland under the leadership of Lawrence Fletcher and one Martin, and
were welcomed with enthusiasm by the king. <a name="citation41a"></a><a
href="#footnote41a" class="citation">[41a]</a>&nbsp; Fletcher was a
colleague of Shakespeare in 1603, but is not known to have been one
earlier.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s company never included an actor named
Martin.&nbsp; Fletcher repeated the visit in October 1601. <a
name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a>&nbsp; There is nothing to indicate that any of
his companions belonged to Shakespeare&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; In like
manner, Shakespeare&rsquo;s accurate reference in &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; to
the &lsquo;nimble&rsquo; but &lsquo;sweet&rsquo; climate of Inverness, <a
name="citation41c"></a><a href="#footnote41c" class="citation">[41c]</a>
and the vivid impression he conveys of <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the aspects of wild
Highland heaths, have been judged to be the certain fruits of a personal
experience; but the passages in question, into which a more definite
significance has possibly been read than Shakespeare intended, can be
satisfactorily accounted for by his inevitable intercourse with Scotsmen in
London and the theatres after James I&rsquo;s accession.</p>
<h3>In Italy.</h3>
<p>A few English actors in Shakespeare&rsquo;s day occasionally combined to
make professional tours through foreign lands, where Court society
invariably gave them a hospitable reception.&nbsp; In Denmark, Germany,
Austria, Holland, and France, many dramatic performances were given before
royal audiences by English actors between 1580 and 1630. <a
name="citation42a"></a><a href="#footnote42a"
class="citation">[42a]</a>&nbsp; That Shakespeare joined any of these
expeditions is highly improbable.&nbsp; Actors of small account at home
mainly took part in them, and Shakespeare&rsquo;s name appears in no extant
list of those who paid professional visits abroad.&nbsp; It is, in fact,
unlikely that Shakespeare ever set foot on the continent of Europe in
either a private or professional capacity.&nbsp; He repeatedly ridicules
the craze for foreign travel. <a name="citation42b"></a><a
href="#footnote42b" class="citation">[42b]</a>&nbsp; To Italy, it is true,
and especially to cities of Northern Italy, like Venice, Padua, Verona,
Mantua, and Milan, he makes frequent and familiar reference, and <!-- page
43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>he supplied
many a realistic portrayal of Italian life and sentiment.&nbsp; But the
fact that he represents Valentine in the &lsquo;Two Gentlemen of
Verona&rsquo; (I. i. 71) as travelling from Verona to Milan by sea, and
Prospero in &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; as embarking on a ship at the gates
of Milan (I. ii. 129-44), renders it almost impossible that he could have
gathered his knowledge of Northern Italy from personal observation. <a
name="citation43a"></a><a href="#footnote43a"
class="citation">[43a]</a>&nbsp; He doubtless owed all to the verbal
reports of travelled friends or to books, the contents of which he had a
rare power of assimilating and vitalising.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s r&ocirc;les.</h3>
<p>The publisher Chettle wrote in 1592 that Shakespeare was &lsquo;exelent
in the qualitie <a name="citation43b"></a><a href="#footnote43b"
class="citation">[43b]</a> he professes,&rsquo; and the old actor William
Beeston asserted in the next century that Shakespeare &lsquo;did act
exceedingly well.&rsquo; <a name="citation43c"></a><a href="#footnote43c"
class="citation">[43c]</a>&nbsp; But the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> in which he
distinguished himself are imperfectly recorded.&nbsp; Few surviving
documents refer directly to performances by him.&nbsp; At Christmas 1594 he
joined the popular actors William Kemp, the chief comedian of the day, and
Richard Burbage, the greatest tragic actor, in &lsquo;two several comedies
or interludes&rsquo; which were acted on St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day and on
Innocents&rsquo; Day (December 27 and 28) at Greenwich Palace before the
Queen.&nbsp; The players received &lsquo;xiii<i>li</i>. vj<i>s</i>.
viii<i>d</i>. and by waye of her Majesties <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>rewarde vi<i>li</i>.
xiii<i>s</i>. iiij<i>d</i>., in all xx<i>li</i>. <a
name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a>&nbsp; Neither plays nor parts are named.&nbsp;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s name stands first on the list of those who took part in
the original performances of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Every Man in his
Humour&rsquo; (1598).&nbsp; In the original edition of Jonson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sejanus&rsquo; (1603) the actors&rsquo; names are arranged in two
columns, and Shakespeare&rsquo;s name heads the second column, standing
parallel with Burbage&rsquo;s, which heads the first.&nbsp; But here again
the character allotted to each actor is not stated.&nbsp; Rowe identified
only one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s parts, &lsquo;the Ghost in his own
&ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo;&rsquo; and Rowe asserted his assumption of that
character to be &lsquo;the top of his performance.&rsquo;&nbsp; John Davies
of Hereford noted that he &lsquo;played some kingly parts in sport.&rsquo;
<a name="citation44b"></a><a href="#footnote44b"
class="citation">[44b]</a>&nbsp; One of Shakespeare&rsquo;s younger
brothers, presumably Gilbert, often came, wrote Oldys, to London in his
younger days to see his brother act in his own plays; and in his old age,
when his memory was failing, he recalled his brother&rsquo;s performance of
Adam in &lsquo;As you like it.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the 1623 folio edition of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Works&rsquo; his name heads the prefatory list
&lsquo;of the principall actors in all these playes.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Alleged scorn of an actor&rsquo;s calling.</h3>
<p>That Shakespeare chafed under some of the conditions of the
actor&rsquo;s calling is commonly inferred from the
&lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; There he reproaches himself with becoming
&lsquo;a motley to the view&rsquo; (cx. 2), and chides fortune for having
provided for his livelihood nothing better than &lsquo;public <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>means that
public manners breed,&rsquo; whence his name received a brand (cxi.
4-5).&nbsp; If such self-pity is to be literally interpreted, it only
reflected an evanescent mood.&nbsp; His interest in all that touched the
efficiency of his profession was permanently active.&nbsp; He was a keen
critic of actors&rsquo; elocution, and in &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; shrewdly
denounced their common failings, but clearly and hopefully pointed out the
road to improvement.&nbsp; His highest ambitions lay, it is true, elsewhere
than in acting, and at an early period of his theatrical career he
undertook, with triumphant success, the labours of a playwright.&nbsp; But
he pursued the profession of an actor loyally and uninterruptedly until he
resigned all connection with the theatre within a few years of his
death.</p>
<h2><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>V.&mdash;EARLY DRAMATIC EFFORTS</h2>
<h3>Dramatic work.</h3>
<p>The whole of Shakespeare&rsquo;s dramatic work was probably begun and
ended within two decades (1591-1611), between his twenty-seventh and
forty-seventh year.&nbsp; If the works traditionally assigned to him
include some contributions from other pens, he was perhaps responsible, on
the other hand, for portions of a few plays that are traditionally claimed
for others.&nbsp; When the account is balanced, Shakespeare must be
credited with the production, during these twenty years, of a yearly
average of two plays, nearly all of which belong to the supreme rank of
literature.&nbsp; Three volumes of poems must be added to the total.&nbsp;
Ben Jonson was often told by the players that &lsquo;whatsoever he penned
he never blotted out (<i>i.e.</i> erased) a line.&rsquo;&nbsp; The editors
of the First Folio attested that &lsquo;what he thought he uttered with
that easinesse that we have scarce received from him a blot in his
papers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Signs of hasty workmanship are not lacking, but they
are few when it is considered how rapidly his numerous compositions came
from his pen, and they are in the aggregate unimportant.</p>
<h3>His borrowed plots.</h3>
<p>By borrowing his plots he to some extent economised his energy, but he
transformed most of them, <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>and it was not probably with the object of
conserving his strength that he systematically levied loans on popular
current literature like Holinshed&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chronicles,&rsquo;
North&rsquo;s translation of &lsquo;Plutarch,&rsquo; widely read romances,
and successful plays.&nbsp; In this regard he betrayed something of the
practical temperament which is traceable in the conduct of the affairs of
his later life.&nbsp; It was doubtless with the calculated aim of
ministering to the public taste that he unceasingly adapted, as his genius
dictated, themes which had already, in the hands of inferior writers or
dramatists, proved capable of arresting public attention.</p>
<h3>The revision of plays.</h3>
<p>The professional playwrights sold their plays outright to one or other
of the acting companies, and they retained no legal interest in them after
the manuscript had passed into the hands of the theatrical manager. <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp;
It was not unusual for the manager to invite extensive revision of a play
at the hands of others than its author before it was produced on the stage,
and again whenever it was revived.&nbsp; Shakespeare gained his earliest
experience as a dramatist by revising or rewriting behind the scenes plays
that had become the property of his manager.&nbsp; It is possible that some
of his labours in this direction <!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>remain unidentified.&nbsp; In a few cases his
alterations were slight, but as a rule his fund of originality was too
abundant to restrict him, when working as an adapter, to mere recension,
and the results of most of his labours in that capacity are entitled to
rank among original compositions.</p>
<h3>Chronology of the plays.&nbsp; Metrical tests.</h3>
<p>The determination of the exact order in which Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays
were written depends largely on conjecture.&nbsp; External evidence is
accessible in only a few cases, and, although always worthy of the utmost
consideration, is not invariably conclusive.&nbsp; The date of publication
rarely indicates the date of composition.&nbsp; Only sixteen of the
thirty-seven plays commonly assigned to Shakespeare were published in his
lifetime, and it is questionable whether any were published under his
supervision. <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a>&nbsp; But subject-matter and metre both afford
rough clues to the period in his career to which each <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>play may be
referred.&nbsp; In his early plays the spirit of comedy or tragedy appears
in its simplicity; as his powers gradually matured he depicted life in its
most complex involutions, and portrayed with masterly insight the subtle
gradations of human sentiment and the mysterious workings of human
passion.&nbsp; Comedy and tragedy are gradually blended; and his work
finally developed a pathos such as could only come of ripe
experience.&nbsp; Similarly the metre undergoes emancipation from the
hampering restraints of fixed rule and becomes flexible enough to respond
to every phase of human feeling.&nbsp; In the blank verse of the early
plays a pause is strictly observed at the close of each line, and rhyming
couplets are frequent.&nbsp; Gradually the poet overrides such artificial
restrictions; rhyme largely disappears; recourse is more frequently made to
prose; the pause is varied indefinitely; extra syllables are, contrary to
strict metrical law, introduced at the end of lines, and at times in the
middle; the last word of the line is often a weak and unemphatic
conjunction or preposition. <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a>&nbsp; To the latest plays fantastic and punning
conceits which abound in early work are rarely accorded admission.&nbsp;
But, while Shakespeare&rsquo;s <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>achievement from the beginning to the end of
his career offers clearer evidence than that of any other writer of genius
of the steady and orderly growth of his poetic faculty, some allowance must
be made for ebb and flow in the current of his artistic progress.&nbsp;
Early work occasionally anticipates features that become habitual to late
work, and late work at times embodies traits that are mainly identified
with early work.&nbsp; No exclusive reliance in determining the precise
chronology can be placed on the merely mechanical tests afforded by tables
of metrical statistics.&nbsp; The chronological order can only be deduced
with any confidence from a consideration of all the internal
characteristics as well as the known external history of each play.&nbsp;
The premisses are often vague and conflicting, and no chronology hitherto
suggested receives at all points universal assent.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>There is no external evidence to prove that any piece in which
Shakespeare had a hand was produced before the spring of 1592.&nbsp; No
play by him was published before 1597, and none bore his name on the
title-page till 1598.&nbsp; But his first essays have been with confidence
allotted to 1591.&nbsp; To &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo;
may reasonably be assigned priority in point of time of all
Shakespeare&rsquo;s dramatic productions.&nbsp; Internal evidence alone
indicates the date of composition, and proves that it was an early effort;
but the subject-matter suggests that its author had already enjoyed
extended opportunities of surveying London life and manners, such as were
hardly open to him in the very first years of his settlement in the <!--
page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>metropolis.&nbsp; &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo;
embodies keen observation of contemporary life in many ranks of society,
both in town and country, while the speeches of the hero Biron clothe much
sound philosophy in masterly rhetoric.&nbsp; Its slender plot stands almost
alone among Shakespeare&rsquo;s plots in that it is not known to have been
borrowed, and stands quite alone in openly travestying known traits and
incidents of current social and political life.&nbsp; The names of the
chief characters are drawn from the leaders in the civil war in France,
which was in progress between 1589 and 1594, and was anxiously watched by
the English public. <a name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a>&nbsp; Contemporary projects of academies for <!--
page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>disciplining young men; fashions of speech and dress current in
fashionable circles; recent attempts on the part of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
government to negotiate with the Tsar of Russia; the inefficiency of rural
constables and the pedantry of village schoolmasters and curates are all
satirised with good humour.&nbsp; The play was revised in 1597, probably
for a performance at Court.&nbsp; It was first published next year, and on
the title-page, which described the piece as &lsquo;newly corrected and
augmented,&rsquo; Shakespeare&rsquo;s name first appeared in print as that
of author of a play.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Two Gentlemen of Verona.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Less gaiety characterised another comedy of the same date, &lsquo;The
Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rsquo; which dramatises a romantic story of love
and friendship.&nbsp; There is every likelihood that it was an
adaptation&mdash;amounting to a <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>reformation&mdash;of a lost &lsquo;History of
Felix and Philomena,&rsquo; which had been acted at Court in 1584.&nbsp;
The story is the same as that of &lsquo;The Shepardess Felismena&rsquo; in
the Spanish pastoral romance of &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; by George de
Montemayor, which long enjoyed popularity in England.&nbsp; No complete
English translation of &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; was published before that of
Bartholomew Yonge in 1598, but a manuscript version by Thomas Wilson, which
was dedicated to the Earl of Southampton in 1596, was possibly circulated
far earlier.&nbsp; Some verses from &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; were translated by
Sir Philip Sidney and were printed with his poems as early as 1591.&nbsp;
Barnabe Rich&rsquo;s story of &lsquo;Apollonius and Silla&rsquo; (from
Cinthio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hecatommithi&rsquo;), which Shakespeare employed
again in &lsquo;Twelfth Night,&rsquo; also gave him some hints.&nbsp;
Trifling and irritating conceits abound in the &lsquo;Two Gentlemen,&rsquo;
but passages of high poetic spirit are not wanting, and the speeches of the
clowns, Launce and Speed&mdash;the precursors of a long line of whimsical
serving-men&mdash;overflow with farcical drollery.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Two
Gentlemen&rsquo; was not published in Shakespeare&rsquo;s lifetime; it
first appeared in the folio of 1623, after having, in all probability,
undergone some revision. <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a></p>
<h3>&lsquo;Comedy of Errors.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Shakespeare next tried his hand, in the &lsquo;Comedy of Errors&rsquo;
(commonly known at the time as &lsquo;Errors&rsquo;), at boisterous
farce.&nbsp; It also was first published in 1623.&nbsp; Again, as in
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost,&rsquo; allusion was made to the
civil war in France.&nbsp; France was described as &lsquo;making war
against her heir&rsquo; <!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>(III. ii. 125).&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
farcical comedy, which is by far the shortest of all his dramas, may have
been founded on a play, no longer extant, called &lsquo;The Historie of
Error,&rsquo; which was acted in 1576 at Hampton Court.&nbsp; In
subject-matter it resembles the &lsquo;Men&aelig;chmi&rsquo; of Plautus,
and treats of mistakes of identity arising from the likeness of twin-born
children.&nbsp; The scene (act iii. sc. i.) in which Antipholus of Ephesus
is shut out from his own house, while his brother and wife are at dinner
within, recalls one in the &lsquo;Amphitruo&rsquo; of Plautus.&nbsp;
Shakespeare doubtless had direct recourse to Plautus as well as to the old
play, and he may have read Plautus in English.&nbsp; The earliest
translation of the &lsquo;Men&aelig;chmi&rsquo; was not licensed for
publication before June 10, 1594, and was not published until the following
year.&nbsp; No translation of any other play of Plautus appeared
before.&nbsp; But it was stated in the preface to this first published
translation of the &lsquo;Men&aelig;chmi&rsquo; that the translator, W. W.,
doubtless William Warner, a veteran of the Elizabethan world of letters,
had some time previously &lsquo;Englished&rsquo; that and
&lsquo;divers&rsquo; others of Plautus&rsquo;s comedies, and had circulated
them in manuscript &lsquo;for the use of and delight of his private
friends, who, in Plautus&rsquo;s own words, are not able to understand
them.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Such plays as these, although each gave promise of a dramatic capacity
out of the common way, cannot be with certainty pronounced to be beyond the
ability of other men.&nbsp; It was in &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s first tragedy, that he proved himself <!-- page 55--><a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the possessor of a
poetic and dramatic instinct of unprecedented quality.&nbsp; In
&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; he turned to account a tragic romance of
Italian origin, <a name="citation55a"></a><a href="#footnote55a"
class="citation">[55a]</a> which was already popular in English
versions.&nbsp; Arthur Broke rendered it into English verse from the
Italian of Bandello in 1562, and William Painter had published it in prose
in his &lsquo;Palace of Pleasure&rsquo; in 1567.&nbsp; Shakespeare made
little change in the plot as drawn from Bandello by Broke, but he
impregnated it with poetic fervour, and relieved the tragic intensity by
developing the humour of Mercutio, and by grafting on the story the new
comic character of the Nurse. <a name="citation55b"></a><a
href="#footnote55b" class="citation">[55b]</a>&nbsp; The ecstasy of
youthful passion is portrayed by Shakespeare in language of the highest
lyric beauty, and although a predilection for quibbles and conceits
occasionally passes beyond the author&rsquo;s control, &lsquo;Romeo and
Juliet,&rsquo; as a tragic poem on the theme of love, has no rival in any
literature.&nbsp; If the Nurse&rsquo;s remark, &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis since the
earthquake now eleven years&rsquo; (I. iii. 23), be taken <!-- page 56--><a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>literally, the
composition of the play must be referred to 1591, for no earthquake in the
sixteenth century was experienced in England after 1580.&nbsp; There are a
few parallelisms with Daniel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Complainte of Rosamond,&rsquo;
published in 1592, and it is probable that Shakespeare completed the piece
in that year.&nbsp; It was first printed anonymously and surreptitiously by
John Danter in 1597 from an imperfect acting copy.&nbsp; A second quarto of
1599 (by T. Creede for Cuthbert Burbie) was printed from an authentic
version, but the piece had probably undergone revision since its first
production. <a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a></p>
<p>Of the original representation on the stage of three other pieces of the
period we have more explicit information.&nbsp; These reveal Shakespeare
undisguisedly as an adapter of plays by other hands.&nbsp; Though they lack
the interest attaching to his unaided work, they throw invaluable light on
some of his early methods of composition and his early relations with other
dramatists.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Henry VI.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>On March 3, 1592, a new piece, called &lsquo;Henry VI,&rsquo; was acted
at the Rose Theatre by Lord Strange&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; It was no doubt the
play which was subsequently known as Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;The First
Part of Henry VI.&rsquo;&nbsp; On its first performance it won a popular
triumph.&nbsp; &lsquo;How would it have joyed brave Talbot (the terror of
the French),&rsquo; wrote Nash in his &lsquo;Pierce Pennilesse&rsquo;
(1592, licensed August 8), in reference to the striking scenes of
Talbot&rsquo;s death (act iv. sc. vi. and vii.), &lsquo;to thinke that
after he had <!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>lyne two hundred yeares in his Tombe, hee should triumphe againe
on the Stage, and have his bones newe embalmed with the teares of ten
thousand spectators at least (at severall times) who, in the Tragedian that
represents his person, imagine they behold him fresh bleeding!&rsquo;&nbsp;
There is no categorical record of the production of a second piece in
continuation of the theme, but such a play quickly followed; for a third
piece, treating of the concluding incidents of Henry VI&rsquo;s reign,
attracted much attention on the stage early in the following autumn.</p>
<h3>Greene&rsquo;s attack.&nbsp; Chettle&rsquo;s apology.</h3>
<p>The applause attending the completion of this historical trilogy caused
bewilderment in the theatrical profession.&nbsp; The older dramatists awoke
to the fact that their popularity was endangered by the young stranger who
had set up his tent in their midst, and one veteran uttered without delay a
rancorous protest.&nbsp; Robert Greene, who died on September 3, 1592,
wrote on his deathbed an ill-natured farewell to life, entitled &lsquo;A
Groats-worth of Wit bought with a Million of Repentance.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Addressing three brother dramatists&mdash;Marlowe, Nash, and Peele or
Lodge&mdash;he bade them beware of puppets &lsquo;that speak from our
mouths,&rsquo; and of &lsquo;antics garnished in our colours.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;There is,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;an upstart Crow, beautified
with our feathers, that with his <i>Tygers heart wrapt in a players
hide</i> supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blanke verse as the
best of you; and being an absolute <i>Johannes factotum</i> is, in his owne
conceit, the only Shake-scene in a countrie. . . .&nbsp; Never more
acquaint [those apes] with your admired inventions, <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>for it is pity men of
such rare wits should be subject to the pleasures of such rude
groomes.&rsquo;&nbsp; The &lsquo;only Shake-scene&rsquo; is a punning
denunciation of Shakespeare.&nbsp; The tirade was probably inspired by an
established author&rsquo;s resentment at the energy of a young
actor&mdash;the theatre&rsquo;s factotum&mdash;in revising the dramatic
work of his seniors with such masterly effect as to imperil their hold on
the esteem of manager and playgoer.&nbsp; The italicised quotation
travesties a line from the third piece in the trilogy of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Henry VI:&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh Tiger&rsquo;s heart wrapt in a woman&rsquo;s hide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Shakespeare&rsquo;s amiability of character and versatile ability
had already won him admirers, and his successes excited the sympathetic
regard of colleagues more kindly than Greene.&nbsp; In December 1592
Greene&rsquo;s publisher, Henry Chettle, prefixed an apology for
Greene&rsquo;s attack on the young actor to his &lsquo;Kind Hartes
Dreame,&rsquo; a tract reflecting on phases of contemporary social
life.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am as sory,&rsquo; Chettle wrote, &lsquo;as if the
originall fault had beene my fault, because myselfe have seene his
[<i>i.e.</i> Shakespeare&rsquo;s] demeanour no lesse civill than he [is]
exelent in the qualitie he professes, besides divers of worship have
reported his uprightnes of dealing, which argues his honesty, and his
facetious grace in writing that aprooves his art.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Divided authorship of &lsquo;Henry VI.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The first of the three plays dealing with the reign of Henry VI was
originally published in the collected edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works;
the second and third <!-- page 59--><a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>plays were previously printed in a form very
different from that which they subsequently assumed when they followed the
first part in the folio.&nbsp; Criticism has proved beyond doubt that in
these plays Shakespeare did no more than add, revise, and correct other
men&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; In &lsquo;The First Part of Henry VI&rsquo; the
scene in the Temple Gardens, where white and red roses are plucked as
emblems by the rival political parties (act ii. sc. iv.), the dying speech
of Mortimer, and perhaps the wooing of Margaret by Suffolk, alone bear the
impress of his style.&nbsp; A play dealing with the second part of Henry
VI&rsquo;s reign was published anonymously from a rough stage copy in 1594,
with the title &lsquo;The first part of the Contention betwixt the two
famous houses of Yorke and Lancaster.&rsquo;&nbsp; A play dealing with the
third part was published with greater care next year under the title
&lsquo;The True Tragedie of Richard, Duke of Yorke, and the death of good
King Henry the Sixt, as it was sundrie times acted by the Earl of Pembroke
his servants.&rsquo;&nbsp; In both these plays Shakespeare&rsquo;s revising
hand can be traced.&nbsp; The humours of Jack Cade in &lsquo;The
Contention&rsquo; can owe their savour to him alone.&nbsp; After he had
hastily revised the original drafts of the three pieces, perhaps with
another&rsquo;s aid, they were put on the stage in 1592, the first two
parts by his own company (Lord Strange&rsquo;s men), and the third, under
some exceptional arrangement, by Lord Pembroke&rsquo;s men.&nbsp; But
Shakespeare was not content to leave them thus.&nbsp; Within a brief <!--
page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>interval,
possibly for a revival, he undertook a more thorough revision, still in
conjunction with another writer.&nbsp; &lsquo;The First Part of The
Contention&rsquo; was thoroughly overhauled, and was converted into what
was entitled in the folio &lsquo;The Second Part of Henry VI;&rsquo; there
more than half the lines are new.&nbsp; &lsquo;The True Tragedie,&rsquo;
which became &lsquo;The Third Part of Henry VI,&rsquo; was less drastically
handled; two-thirds of it was left practically untouched; only a third was
thoroughly remodelled. <a name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a></p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s coadjutors.</h3>
<p>Who Shakespeare&rsquo;s coadjutors were in the two successive revisions
of &lsquo;Henry VI&rsquo; is matter for conjecture.&nbsp; The theory that
Greene and Peele produced the original draft of the three parts of
&lsquo;Henry VI,&rsquo; which Shakespeare recast, may help to account for
Greene&rsquo;s indignant denunciation of Shakespeare as &lsquo;an upstart
crow, beautified with the feathers&rsquo; of himself and his fellow
dramatists.&nbsp; Much can be said, too, in behalf of the suggestion that
Shakespeare joined Marlowe, the greatest of his predecessors, in the first
revision of which &lsquo;The Contention&rsquo; and the &lsquo;True
Tragedie&rsquo; were the outcome.&nbsp; Most of the new passages in the
second recension seem assignable to Shakespeare alone, but a few suggest a
partnership resembling that of the first revision.&nbsp; It is probable
that Marlowe began the final revision, but his task was interrupted by his
death, and the lion&rsquo;s share of the work fell to his younger
coadjutor.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s assimilative power.</h3>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>Shakespeare shared with other men of genius that receptivity of
mind which impels them to assimilate much of the intellectual effort of
their contemporaries and to transmute it in the process from unvalued ore
into pure gold.&nbsp; Had Shakespeare not been professionally employed in
recasting old plays by contemporaries, he would doubtless have shown in his
writings traces of a study of their work.&nbsp; The verses of Thomas
Watson, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, Sir Philip Sidney, and Thomas Lodge
were certainly among the rills which fed the mighty river of his poetic and
lyric invention.&nbsp; Kyd and Greene, among rival writers of tragedy, left
more or less definite impression on all Shakespeare&rsquo;s early efforts
in tragedy.&nbsp; It was, however, only to two of his fellow dramatists
that his indebtedness as a writer of either comedy or tragedy was material
or emphatically defined.&nbsp; Superior as Shakespeare&rsquo;s powers were
to those of Marlowe, his coadjutor in &lsquo;Henry VI,&rsquo; his early
tragedies often reveal him in the character of a faithful disciple of that
vehement delineator of tragic passion.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s early
comedies disclose a like relationship between him and Lyly.</p>
<h3>Lyly&rsquo;s influence in comedy.</h3>
<p>Lyly is best known as the author of the affected romance of
&lsquo;Euphues,&rsquo; but between 1580 and 1592 he produced eight trivial
and insubstantial comedies, of which six were written in prose, one was in
blank verse, and one was in rhyme.&nbsp; Much of the dialogue in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedies, from &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost&rsquo; to &lsquo;Much Ado about Nothing,&rsquo; <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>consists in thrusting
and parrying fantastic conceits, puns, or antitheses.&nbsp; This is the
style of intercourse in which most of Lyly&rsquo;s characters exclusively
indulge.&nbsp; Three-fourths of Lyly&rsquo;s comedies lightly revolve about
topics of classical or fairy mythology&mdash;in the very manner which
Shakespeare first brought to a triumphant issue in his &lsquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s treatment of
eccentric character like Don Armado in &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost&rsquo; and his boy Moth reads like a reminiscence of Lyly&rsquo;s
portrayal of Sir Thopas, a fat vainglorious knight, and his boy Epiton in
the comedy of &lsquo;Endymion,&rsquo; while the watchmen in the same play
clearly adumbrate Shakespeare&rsquo;s Dogberry and Verges.&nbsp; The device
of masculine disguise for love-sick maidens was characteristic of
Lyly&rsquo;s method before Shakespeare ventured on it for the first of many
times in &lsquo;Two Gentlemen of Verona,&rsquo; and the dispersal through
Lyly&rsquo;s comedies of songs possessing every lyrical charm is not the
least interesting of the many striking features which Shakespeare&rsquo;s
achievements in comedy seem to borrow from Lyly&rsquo;s comparatively
insignificant experiments. <a name="citation62"></a><a href="#footnote62"
class="citation">[62]</a></p>
<h3>Marlowe&rsquo;s influence in tragedy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Richard
III.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Marlowe, who alone of Shakespeare&rsquo;s contemporaries can be credited
with exerting on his efforts <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>in tragedy a really substantial influence, was
in 1592 and 1593 at the zenith of his fame.&nbsp; Two of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s earliest historical tragedies, &lsquo;Richard
III&rsquo; and &lsquo;Richard II,&rsquo; with the story of Shylock in his
somewhat later comedy of the &lsquo;Merchant of Venice,&rsquo; plainly
disclose a conscious resolve to follow in Marlowe&rsquo;s footsteps.&nbsp;
In &lsquo;Richard III&rsquo; Shakespeare, working single-handed, takes up
the history of England near the point at which Marlowe and he, apparently
working in partnership, left it in the third part of &lsquo;Henry
VI.&rsquo;&nbsp; The subject was already familiar to dramatists, but
Shakespeare sought his materials in the &lsquo;Chronicle&rsquo; of
Holinshed.&nbsp; A Latin piece, by Dr. Thomas Legge, had been in favour
with academic audiences since 1579, and in 1594 the &lsquo;True Tragedie of
Richard III&rsquo; from some other pen was published anonymously; but
Shakespeare&rsquo;s piece bears little resemblance to either.&nbsp;
Throughout Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Richard III&rsquo; the effort to
emulate Marlowe is undeniable.&nbsp; The tragedy is, says Mr. Swinburne,
&lsquo;as fiery in passion, as single in purpose, as rhetorical often,
though never so inflated in expression, as Marlowe&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Tamburlaine&rdquo; itself.&rsquo;&nbsp; The turbulent piece was
naturally popular.&nbsp; Burbage&rsquo;s impersonation of the hero was one
of his most effective performances, and his vigorous enunciation of
&lsquo;A horse, a horse! my kingdom for a horse!&rsquo; gave the line
proverbial currency.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Richard II.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Richard II&rsquo; seems to have followed &lsquo;Richard
III&rsquo; without delay.&nbsp; Subsequently both were published
anonymously in the same year (1597) as they had <!-- page 64--><a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>&lsquo;been publikely
acted by the right Honorable the Lorde Chamberlaine his servants;&rsquo;
but the deposition scene in &lsquo;Richard II,&rsquo; which dealt with a
topic distasteful to the Queen, was omitted from the early
impressions.&nbsp; Prose is avoided throughout the play, a certain sign of
early work.&nbsp; The piece was probably composed very early in 1593.&nbsp;
Marlowe&rsquo;s tempestuous vein is less apparent in &lsquo;Richard
II&rsquo; than in &lsquo;Richard III.&rsquo;&nbsp; But if &lsquo;Richard
II&rsquo; be in style and treatment less deeply indebted to Marlowe than
its predecessor, it was clearly suggested by Marlowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Edward
II.&rsquo;&nbsp; Throughout its exposition of the leading theme&mdash;the
development and collapse of the weak king&rsquo;s
character&mdash;Shakespeare&rsquo;s historical tragedy closely imitates
Marlowe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Shakespeare drew the facts from Holinshed, but his
embellishments are numerous, and include the magnificently eloquent eulogy
of England which is set in the mouth of John of Gaunt.</p>
<h3>Acknowledgments to Marlowe.</h3>
<p>In &lsquo;As you like it&rsquo; (III. v. 80) Shakespeare parenthetically
commemorated his acquaintance with, and his general indebtedness to, the
elder dramatist by apostrophising him in the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dead Shepherd! now I find thy saw of might:<br />
&lsquo;Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second line is a quotation from Marlowe&rsquo;s poem &lsquo;Hero and
Leander&rsquo; (line 76).&nbsp; In the &lsquo;Merry Wives of Windsor&rsquo;
(III. i. 17-21) Shakespeare places in the mouth of Sir Hugh Evans snatches
of verse from <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>Marlowe&rsquo;s charming lyric, &lsquo;Come live with me and be my
love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Between February 1593 and the end of the year the London theatres were
closed, owing to the prevalence of the plague, and Shakespeare doubtless
travelled with his company in the country.&nbsp; But his pen was busily
employed, and before the close of 1594 he gave marvellous proofs of his
rapid powers of production.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Titus Andronicus.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Titus Andronicus&rsquo; was in his own lifetime claimed for
Shakespeare, but Edward Ravenscroft, who prepared a new version in 1678,
wrote of it: &lsquo;I have been told by some anciently conversant with the
stage that it was not originally his, but brought by a private author to be
acted, and he only gave some master-touches to one or two of the principal
parts or characters.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ravenscroft&rsquo;s assertion deserves
acceptance.&nbsp; The tragedy, a sanguinary picture of the decadence of
Imperial Rome, contains powerful lines and situations, but is far too
repulsive in plot and treatment, and too ostentatious in classical
allusions, to take rank with Shakespeare&rsquo;s acknowledged work.&nbsp;
Ben Jonson credits &lsquo;Titus Andronicus&rsquo; with a popularity
equalling Kyd&rsquo;s &lsquo;Spanish Tragedy,&rsquo; and internal evidence
shows that Kyd was capable of writing much of &lsquo;Titus.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
was suggested by a piece called &lsquo;Titus and Vespasian,&rsquo; which
Lord Strange&rsquo;s men played on April 11, 1592; <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65" class="citation">[65]</a> this
is only extant in a German version acted by English players in Germany, and
published in <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>1620. <a name="citation66a"></a><a href="#footnote66a"
class="citation">[66a]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Titus Andronicus&rsquo; was
obviously taken in hand soon after the production of &lsquo;Titus and
Vespasian&rsquo; in order to exploit popular interest in the topic.&nbsp;
It was acted by the Earl of Sussex&rsquo;s men on January 23, 1593-4, when
it was described as a new piece; but that it was also acted subsequently by
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company is shown by the title-page of the first extant
edition of 1600, which describes it as having been performed by the Earl of
Derby&rsquo;s and the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s servants (successive titles
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company), as well as by those of the Earls of
Pembroke and Sussex.&nbsp; It was entered on the &lsquo;Stationers&rsquo;
Register&rsquo; to John Danter on February 6, 1594. <a
name="citation66b"></a><a href="#footnote66b"
class="citation">[66b]</a>&nbsp; Langbaine claims to have seen an edition
of this date, but none earlier than that of 1600 is now known.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Merchant of Venice.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>For part of the plot of &lsquo;The Merchant of Venice,&rsquo; in which
two romantic love stories are skilfully blended with a theme of tragic
import, Shakespeare had recourse to &lsquo;Il Pecorone,&rsquo; a
fourteenth-century collection of Italian novels by Ser Giovanni Fiorentino.
<a name="citation66c"></a><a href="#footnote66c"
class="citation">[66c]</a>&nbsp; There a Jewish creditor demands a pound of
flesh of a defaulting Christian debtor, and the latter is rescued through
the advocacy of &lsquo;the lady of Belmont,&rsquo; who is wife of the
debtor&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; The management of the plot in the <!-- page
67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Italian novel
is closely followed by Shakespeare.&nbsp; A similar story is slenderly
outlined in the popular medieval collection of anecdotes called
&lsquo;Gesta Romanorum,&rsquo; while the tale of the caskets, which
Shakespeare combined with it in the &lsquo;Merchant,&rsquo; is told
independently in another portion of the same work.&nbsp; But
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Merchant&rsquo; owes much to other sources,
including more than one old play.&nbsp; Stephen Gosson describes in his
&lsquo;Schoole of Abuse&rsquo; (1579) a lost play called &lsquo;the Jew . .
. showne at the Bull [inn]. . . representing the greedinesse of worldly
chusers and bloody mindes of usurers.&rsquo;&nbsp; This description
suggests that the two stories of the pound of flesh and the caskets had
been combined before for purposes of dramatic representation.&nbsp; The
scenes in Shakespeare&rsquo;s play in which Antonio negotiates with Shylock
are roughly anticipated, too, by dialogues between a Jewish creditor
Gerontus and a Christian debtor in the extant play of &lsquo;The Three
Ladies of London,&rsquo; by R[obert] W[ilson], 1584.&nbsp; There the Jew
opens the attack on his Christian debtor with the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Signor Mercatore, why do you not pay me?&nbsp; Think you I will be
mocked in this sort?<br />
This three times you have flouted me&mdash;it seems you make thereat a
sport.<br />
Truly pay me my money, and that even now presently,<br />
Or by mighty Mahomet, I swear I will forthwith arrest thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, when the judge is passing judgment in favour of the
debtor, the Jew interrupts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stay, there, most puissant judge.&nbsp; Signor Mercatore consider what
you do.<br />
Pay me the principal, as for the interest I forgive it you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Shylock and Roderigo Lopez.</h3>
<p><!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Above all is it of interest to note that Shakespeare in &lsquo;The
Merchant of Venice&rsquo; betrays the last definable traces of his
discipleship to Marlowe.&nbsp; Although the delicate comedy which lightens
the serious interest of Shakespeare&rsquo;s play sets it in a wholly
different category from that of Marlowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Jew of Malta&rsquo;,
the humanised portrait of the Jew Shylock embodies distinct reminiscences
of Marlowe&rsquo;s caricature of the Jew Barabbas.&nbsp; But Shakespeare
soon outpaced his master, and the inspiration that he drew from Marlowe in
the &lsquo;Merchant&rsquo; touches only the general conception of the
central figure.&nbsp; Doubtless the popular interest aroused by the trial
in February 1594 and the execution in June of the Queen&rsquo;s Jewish
physician, Roderigo Lopez, incited Shakespeare to a new and subtler study
of Jewish character. <a name="citation68"></a><a href="#footnote68"
class="citation">[68]</a>&nbsp; For Shylock (not the merchant Antonio) <!--
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>is the
hero of the play, and the main interest culminates in the Jew&rsquo;s trial
and discomfiture.&nbsp; The bold transition from that solemn scene which
trembles on the brink of tragedy to the gently poetic and humorous
incidents of the concluding act attests a mastery of stagecraft; but the
interest, although it is sustained to the end, is, after Shylock&rsquo;s
final exit, pitched in a lower key.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Venesyon
Comedy,&rsquo; which Henslowe, the manager, produced at the Rose on August
25, 1594, was probably the earliest version of &lsquo;The Merchant of
Venice,&rsquo; and it was revised later.&nbsp; It was not published till
1600, when two editions appeared, each printed from a different stage
copy.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;King John.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>To 1594 must also be assigned &lsquo;King John,&rsquo; which, like the
&lsquo;Comedy of Errors&rsquo; and &lsquo;Richard II,&rsquo; altogether
eschews prose.&nbsp; The piece, which was not printed till 1623, was
directly adapted from a worthless play called &lsquo;The Troublesome Raigne
of King John&rsquo; (1591), which was fraudulently reissued in 1611 as
&lsquo;written by W. Sh.,&rsquo; and in 1622 as by &lsquo;W.
Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is very small ground for associating
Marlowe&rsquo;s name with the old play.&nbsp; Into the adaptation
Shakespeare flung all his energy, and the theme grew under his hand into
genuine tragedy.&nbsp; The three chief characters&mdash;the mean and cruel
king, <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>the noblehearted and desperately wronged Constance, and the
soldierly humourist, Faulconbridge&mdash;are in all essentials of his own
invention, and are portrayed with the same sureness of touch that marked in
Shylock his rapidly maturing strength.&nbsp; The scene, in which the gentle
boy Arthur learns from Hubert that the king has ordered his eyes to be put
out, is as affecting as any passage in tragic literature.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Comedy of Errors&rsquo; in Gray&rsquo;s Inn Hall.</h3>
<p>At the close of 1594 a performance of Shakespeare&rsquo;s early farce,
&lsquo;The Comedy of Errors,&rsquo; gave him a passing notoriety that he
could well have spared.&nbsp; The piece was played on the evening of
Innocents&rsquo; Day (December 28), 1594, in the hall of Gray&rsquo;s Inn,
before a crowded audience of benchers, students, and their friends.&nbsp;
There was some disturbance during the evening on the part of guests from
the Inner Temple, who, dissatisfied with the accommodation afforded them,
retired in dudgeon.&nbsp; &lsquo;So that night,&rsquo; the contemporary
chronicler states, &lsquo;was begun and continued to the end in nothing but
confusion and errors, whereupon it was ever afterwards called the
&ldquo;Night of Errors.&rdquo;&rsquo; <a name="citation70"></a><a
href="#footnote70" class="citation">[70]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare was acting
on the same day before the Queen at Greenwich, and it is doubtful if he
were present.&nbsp; On the morrow a commission of oyer and terminer
inquired into the causes of the tumult, which was attributed to a sorcerer
having &lsquo;foisted a company of base and common fellows to <!-- page
71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>make up our
disorders with a play of errors and confusions.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Early plays doubtfully assigned to Shakespeare.</h3>
<p>Two plays of uncertain authorship attracted public attention during the
period under review (1591-4)&mdash;&lsquo;Arden of Feversham&rsquo;
(licensed for publication April 3, 1592, and published in 1592) and
&lsquo;Edward III&rsquo; (licensed for publication December 1, 1595, and
published in 1596).&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s hand has been traced in both,
mainly on the ground that their dramatic energy is of a quality not to be
discerned in the work of any contemporary whose writings are extant.&nbsp;
There is no external evidence in favour of Shakespeare&rsquo;s authorship
in either case.&nbsp; &lsquo;Arden of Feversham&rsquo; dramatises with
intensity and insight a sordid murder of a husband by a wife which took
place at Faversham in 1551, and was fully reported by Holinshed.&nbsp; The
subject is of a different type from any which Shakespeare is known to have
treated, and although the play may be, as Mr. Swinburne insists, &lsquo;a
young man&rsquo;s work,&rsquo; it bears no relation either in topic or
style to the work on which young Shakespeare was engaged at a period so
early as 1591 or 1592.&nbsp; &lsquo;Edward III&rsquo; is a play in
Marlowe&rsquo;s vein, and has been assigned to Shakespeare on even more
shadowy grounds.&nbsp; Capell reprinted it in his &lsquo;Prolusions&rsquo;
in 1760, and described it as &lsquo;thought to be writ by
Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many speeches scattered through the drama, and
one whole scene&mdash;that in which the Countess of Salisbury repulses the
advances of Edward III&mdash;show the hand of a master (act ii. sc.
ii.)&nbsp; But there is even in the style of <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>these contributions
much to dissociate them from Shakespeare&rsquo;s acknowledged productions,
and to justify their ascription to some less gifted disciple of Marlowe. <a
name="citation72a"></a><a href="#footnote72a"
class="citation">[72a]</a>&nbsp; A line in act ii. sc. i. (&lsquo;Lilies
that fester smell far worse than weeds&rsquo;) reappears in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets&rsquo; (xciv. l. 14). <a
name="citation72b"></a><a href="#footnote72b"
class="citation">[72b]</a>&nbsp; It was contrary to his practice to
literally plagiarise himself.&nbsp; The line in the play was doubtless
borrowed from a manuscript copy of the &lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Mucedorus.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Two other popular plays of the period, &lsquo;Mucedorus&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Faire Em,&rsquo; have also been assigned to Shakespeare on slighter
provocation.&nbsp; In Charles II.&rsquo;s library they were bound together
in a volume labelled &lsquo;Shakespeare, Vol. I.,&rsquo; and bold
speculators have occasionally sought to justify the misnomer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mucedorus,&rsquo; an elementary effort in romantic comedy, dates
from the early years of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign; it was first published,
doubtless after undergoing revision, in 1595, and was reissued,
&lsquo;amplified with new additions,&rsquo; in 1610.&nbsp; Mr. Payne
Collier, who included it in his privately printed edition of Shakespeare in
1878, was confident that a scene interpolated in the 1610 version (in which
the King of Valentia laments the supposed loss of his son) displayed genius
which Shakespeare alone could compass.&nbsp; However readily critics may
admit the superiority in literary value of the interpolated scene to
anything else in the piece, few will accept Mr. Collier&rsquo;s extravagant
estimate.&nbsp; The scene was probably from <!-- page 73--><a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the pen of an admiring
but faltering imitator of Shakespeare. <a name="citation73"></a><a
href="#footnote73" class="citation">[73]</a></p>
<h3>&lsquo;Faire Em.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Faire Em,&rsquo; although not published till 1631, was acted by
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company while Lord Strange was its patron, and some
lines from it are quoted for purposes of ridicule by Robert Greene in his
&lsquo;Farewell to Folly&rsquo; in 1592.&nbsp; It is another rudimentary
endeavour in romantic comedy, and has not even the pretension of
&lsquo;Mucedorus&rsquo; to one short scene of conspicuous literary
merit.</p>
<h2><!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>VI&mdash;THE FIRST APPEAL TO THE READING PUBLIC</h2>
<h3>Publication of &lsquo;Venus and Adonis.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>During the busy years (1591-4) that witnessed his first pronounced
successes as a dramatist, Shakespeare came before the public in yet another
literary capacity.&nbsp; On April 18, 1593, Richard Field, the printer, who
was his fellow-townsman, obtained a license for the publication of
&lsquo;Venus and Adonis,&rsquo; a metrical version of a classical tale of
love.&nbsp; It was published a month or two later, without an
author&rsquo;s name on the title-page, but Shakespeare appended his full
name to the dedication, which he addressed in conventional style to Henry
Wriothesley, third earl of Southampton.&nbsp; The Earl, who was in his
twentieth year, was reckoned the handsomest man at Court, with a pronounced
disposition to gallantry.&nbsp; He had vast possessions, was well educated,
loved literature, and through life extended to men of letters a generous
patronage. <a name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;I know not how I shall
offend,&rsquo; Shakespeare now wrote to him, &lsquo;in dedicating my
unpolished lines to your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for
choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burden. . . .&nbsp; But if
the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be sorry it had so
noble <!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>a godfather.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The first heir of my
invention&rsquo; implies that the poem was written, or at least designed,
before Shakespeare&rsquo;s dramatic work.&nbsp; It is affluent in beautiful
imagery and metrical sweetness, but imbued with a tone of license which may
be held either to justify the theory that it was a precocious product of
the author&rsquo;s youth, or to show that Shakespeare was not unready in
mature years to write with a view to gratifying a patron&rsquo;s somewhat
lascivious tastes.&nbsp; The title-page bears a beautiful Latin motto from
Ovid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Amores:&rsquo; <a name="citation75a"></a><a
href="#footnote75a" class="citation">[75a]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo<br />
Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The influence of Ovid, who told the story in his
&lsquo;Metamorphoses,&rsquo; is apparent in many of the details.&nbsp; But
the theme was doubtless first suggested to Shakespeare by a contemporary
effort.&nbsp; Lodge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Scillaes Metamorphosis,&rsquo; which
appeared in 1589, is not only written in the same metre (six-line stanzas
rhyming <i>a b a b c c</i>), but narrates in the exordium the same
incidents in the same spirit.&nbsp; There is little doubt that Shakespeare
drew from Lodge some of his inspiration. <a name="citation75b"></a><a
href="#footnote75b" class="citation">[75b]</a></p>
<h3>&lsquo;Lucrece.&rsquo;</h3>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>A
year after the issue of &lsquo;Venus and Adonis,&rsquo; in 1594,
Shakespeare published another poem in like vein, but far more mature in
temper and execution.&nbsp; The digression (ll. 939-59) on the destroying
power of Time, especially, is in an exalted key of meditation which is not
sounded in the earlier poem.&nbsp; The metre, too, is changed; seven-line
stanzas (Chaucer&rsquo;s rhyme royal, <i>a b a b b c c</i>) take the place
of six-line stanzas.&nbsp; The second poem was entered in the
&lsquo;Stationers&rsquo; Registers&rsquo; on May 9, 1594, under the title
of &lsquo;A Booke intitled the Ravyshement of Lucrece,&rsquo; and was
published in the same year under the title &lsquo;Lucrece.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Richard Field printed it, and John Harrison published and sold it at the
sign of the White Greyhound in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard.&nbsp; The
classical story of Lucretia&rsquo;s ravishment and suicide is briefly
recorded in Ovid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fasti,&rsquo; but Chaucer had retold it in
his &lsquo;Legend of Good Women,&rsquo; and Shakespeare must have read it
there.&nbsp; Again, in topic and metre, the poem reflected a contemporary
poet&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Samuel Daniel&rsquo;s <!-- page 77--><a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>&lsquo;Complaint of
Rosamond,&rsquo; with its seven-line stanza (1592), stood to
&lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; in even closer relation than Lodge&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Scilla,&rsquo; with its six-line stanza, to &lsquo;Venus and
Adonis.&rsquo;&nbsp; The pathetic accents of Shakespeare&rsquo;s heroine
are those of Daniel&rsquo;s heroine purified and glorified. <a
name="citation77a"></a><a href="#footnote77a"
class="citation">[77a]</a>&nbsp; The passage on Time is elaborated from one
in Watson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Passionate Centurie of Love&rsquo; (No. lxxvii.)
<a name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare dedicated his second volume of
poetry to the Earl of Southampton, the patron of his first.&nbsp; He
addressed him in terms of devoted friendship, which were not uncommon at
the time in communications between patrons and poets, but suggest that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s relations with the brilliant young nobleman had grown
closer since <!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>he dedicated &lsquo;Venus and Adonis&rsquo; to him in colder
language a year before.&nbsp; &lsquo;The love I dedicate to your
lordship,&rsquo; Shakespeare wrote in the opening pages of
&lsquo;Lucrece,&rsquo; &lsquo;is without end, whereof this pamphlet without
beginning is but a superfluous moiety. . .&nbsp; What I have done is yours;
what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted
yours.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic reception of the poems.</h3>
<p>In these poems Shakespeare made his earliest appeal to the world of
readers, and the reading public welcomed his addresses with unqualified
enthusiasm.&nbsp; The London playgoer already knew Shakespeare&rsquo;s name
as that of a promising actor and playwright, but his dramatic efforts had
hitherto been consigned in manuscript, as soon as the theatrical
representation ceased, to the coffers of their owner, the playhouse
manager.&nbsp; His early plays brought him at the outset little reputation
as a man of letters.&nbsp; It was not as the myriad-minded dramatist, but
in the restricted role of adapter for English readers of familiar Ovidian
fables, that he first impressed a wide circle of his contemporaries with
the fact of his mighty genius.&nbsp; The perfect sweetness of the verse,
and the poetical imagery in &lsquo;Venus and Adonis&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; practically silenced censure of the licentious
treatment of the themes on the part of the seriously minded.&nbsp; Critics
vied with each other in the exuberance of the eulogies in which they
proclaimed that the fortunate author had gained a place in permanence on
the summit of Parnassus.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lucrece,&rsquo; wrote Michael Drayton
in his &lsquo;Legend of Matilda&rsquo; (1594), was &lsquo;revived to live
another age.&rsquo;&nbsp; In <!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>1595 William Clerke in his
&lsquo;Polimanteia&rsquo; gave &lsquo;all praise&rsquo; to &lsquo;sweet
Shakespeare&rsquo; for his &lsquo;Lucrecia.&rsquo;&nbsp; John Weever, in a
sonnet addressed to &lsquo;honey-tongued Shakespeare&rsquo; in his
&lsquo;Epigramms&rsquo; (1595), eulogised the two poems as an unmatchable
achievement, although he mentioned the plays &lsquo;Romeo&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Richard&rsquo; and &lsquo;more whose names I know not.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Richard Carew at the same time classed him with Marlowe as deserving the
praises of an English Catullus. <a name="citation79"></a><a
href="#footnote79" class="citation">[79]</a>&nbsp; Printers and publishers
of the poems strained their resources to satisfy the demands of eager
purchasers.&nbsp; No fewer than seven editions of &lsquo;Venus&rsquo;
appeared between 1594 and 1602; an eighth followed in 1617.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; achieved a fifth edition in the year of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare and Spenser.</h3>
<p>There is a likelihood, too, that Spenser, the greatest of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s poetic contemporaries, was first drawn by the poems
into the ranks of Shakespeare&rsquo;s admirers.&nbsp; It is hardly doubtful
that Spenser described Shakespeare in &lsquo;Colin Clouts come home
againe&rsquo; (completed in 1594), under the name of
&lsquo;Aetion&rsquo;&mdash;a familiar Greek proper name derived from
&Alpha;&epsilon;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;, an eagle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there, though last not least is Aetion;<br />
&nbsp;  A gentler Shepheard may no where be found,<br />
Whose muse, full of high thought&rsquo;s invention,<br />
&nbsp;  Doth, like himselfe, heroically sound.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last line seems to allude to Shakespeare&rsquo;s surname.&nbsp; We
may assume that the admiration was <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>mutual.&nbsp; At any
rate Shakespeare acknowledged acquaintance with Spenser&rsquo;s work in a
plain reference to his &lsquo;Teares of the Muses&rsquo; (1591) in
&lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo; (v. i. 52-3).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The thrice three Muses, mourning for the death<br />
Of learning, late deceased in beggary,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is stated to be the theme of one of the dramatic entertainments
wherewith it is proposed to celebrate Theseus&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp; In
Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Teares of the Muses&rsquo; each of the Nine laments
in turn her declining influence on the literary and dramatic effort of the
age.&nbsp; Theseus dismisses the suggestion with the not inappropriate
comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is some satire keen and critical,<br />
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there is no ground for assuming that Spenser in the same poem
referred figuratively to Shakespeare when he made Thalia deplore the recent
death of &lsquo;our pleasant Willy.&rsquo; <a name="citation80"></a><a
href="#footnote80" class="citation">[80]</a>&nbsp; The name Willy was
frequently used in contemporary literature as a term of familiarity without
relation to the baptismal name of the person referred to.&nbsp; Sir Philip
Sidney was <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>addressed as &lsquo;Willy&rsquo; by some of his elegists.&nbsp; A
comic actor, &lsquo;dead of late&rsquo; in a literal sense, was clearly
intended by Spenser, and there is no reason to dispute the view of an early
seventeenth-century commentator that Spenser was paying a tribute to the
loss English comedy had lately sustained by the death of the comedian,
Richard Tarleton. <a name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a"
class="citation">[81a]</a>&nbsp; Similarly the &lsquo;gentle spirit&rsquo;
who is described by Spenser in a later stanza as sitting &lsquo;in idle
cell&rsquo; rather than turn his pen to base uses cannot be reasonably
identified with Shakespeare. <a name="citation81b"></a><a
href="#footnote81b" class="citation">[81b]</a></p>
<h3>Patrons at court.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile Shakespeare was gaining personal esteem outside the circles of
actors and men of letters.&nbsp; His genius and &lsquo;civil
demeanour&rsquo; of which Chettle wrote arrested the notice not only of
Southampton but of other noble patrons of literature and the drama.&nbsp;
His summons to act at Court with the most famous actors of the day at the
Christmas of 1594 was possibly due in part to personal interest in
himself.&nbsp; Elizabeth quickly showed him special favour.&nbsp; Until the
end of her reign his plays were repeatedly acted in her presence.&nbsp; The
revised version of &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Lost&rsquo; was given
at Whitehall at Christmas 1597, and tradition credits the Queen with
unconcealed enthusiasm for Falstaff, who came into being a little
later.&nbsp; Under Elizabeth&rsquo;s successor he greatly strengthened his
hold on royal favour, but Ben Jonson claimed that the Queen&rsquo;s
appreciation equalled that of James I.&nbsp; When Jonson wrote in his elegy
on Shakespeare of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those flights upon the banks of Thames<br />
That so did take Eliza and our James,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he was mindful of many representations of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays by
the poet and his fellow-actors at the palaces of Whitehall, Richmond, or
Greenwich during the last decade of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<h2><!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>VII&mdash;THE SONNETS AND THEIR LITERARY HISTORY</h2>
<h3>The vogue of the Elizabethan sonnet.</h3>
<p>It was doubtless to Shakespeare&rsquo;s personal relations with men and
women of the Court that his sonnets owed their existence.&nbsp; In Italy
and France, the practice of writing and circulating series of sonnets
inscribed to great men and women flourished continuously throughout the
sixteenth century.&nbsp; In England, until the last decade of that century,
the vogue was intermittent.&nbsp; Wyatt and Surrey inaugurated
sonnetteering in the English language under Henry VIII, and Thomas Watson
devoted much energy to the pursuit when Shakespeare was a boy.&nbsp; But it
was not until 1591, when Sir Philip Sidney&rsquo;s collection of sonnets
entitled &lsquo;Astrophel and Stella&rsquo; was first published, that the
sonnet enjoyed in England any conspicuous or continuous favour.&nbsp; For
the half-dozen years following the appearance of Sir Philip Sidney&rsquo;s
volume the writing of sonnets, both singly and in connected sequences,
engaged more literary activity in this country than it engaged at any
period here or elsewhere. <a name="citation83"></a><a href="#footnote83"
class="citation">[83]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Men and women of the cultivated Elizabethan
nobility encouraged poets to celebrate in single sonnets their virtues and
graces, and under the same patronage there were produced multitudes of
sonnet-sequences which more or less fancifully narrated, after the manner
of Petrarch and his successors, the pleasures and pains of love.&nbsp;
Between 1591 and 1597 no aspirant to poetic fame in the country failed to
seek a patron&rsquo;s ears by a trial of skill on the popular poetic
instrument, and Shakespeare, who habitually kept abreast of the currents of
contemporary literary taste, applied himself to sonnetteering with all the
force of his poetic genius when the fashion was at its height.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s first experiments.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare had lightly experimented with the sonnet from the outset of
his literary career.&nbsp; Three well-turned examples figure in
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost,&rsquo; probably his earliest play;
two of the choruses in &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; are couched in the
sonnet form; and a letter of the heroine Helen, in &lsquo;All&rsquo;s Well
that Ends Well,&rsquo; which bears traces of very early composition, takes
the same shape.&nbsp; It has, too, been argued ingeniously, if not
convincingly, that he was author of the somewhat clumsy sonnet,
&lsquo;Phaeton to his friend Florio,&rsquo; which prefaced in 1591
Florio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Second Frutes,&rsquo; a series of Italian-English
dialogues for students. <a name="citation84"></a><a href="#footnote84"
class="citation">[84]</a></p>
<h3>Majority of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets composed in 1594.</h3>
<p><!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>But these were sporadic efforts.&nbsp; It was not till the spring
of 1593, after Shakespeare had secured a nobleman&rsquo;s patronage for his
earliest publication, &lsquo;Venus and Adonis,&rsquo; that he became a
sonnetteer on an extended scale.&nbsp; Of the hundred and fifty-four
sonnets that survive outside his plays, the greater number were in all
likelihood composed between that date and the autumn of 1594, during his
thirtieth and thirty-first years.&nbsp; His occasional reference in the
sonnets to his growing age was a conventional device&mdash;traceable to
Petrarch&mdash;of all sonnetteers of the day, and admits of <!-- page
86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>no literal
interpretation. <a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86"
class="citation">[86]</a>&nbsp; In matter and in manner the bulk of the
poems suggest that they came from the pen of a man not much more than
thirty.&nbsp; Doubtless he renewed his sonnetteering efforts occasionally
<!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>and
at irregular intervals during the nine years which elapsed between 1594 and
the accession of James I in 1603.&nbsp; But to very few of the extant
examples can a date later than 1594 be allotted with confidence.&nbsp;
Sonnet cvii., in which plain reference is made to Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
death, may be fairly regarded as a belated and a final act of homage on
Shakespeare&rsquo;s part to the importunate vogue of the Elizabethan
sonnet.&nbsp; All the evidence, whether internal or external, points to the
conclusion that the sonnet exhausted such fascination as it exerted on
Shakespeare before his dramatic genius attained its full height.</p>
<h3>Their literary value.</h3>
<p>In literary value Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets are notably unequal.&nbsp;
Many reach levels of lyric melody and meditative energy that are hardly to
be matched elsewhere in poetry.&nbsp; The best examples are charged with
the mellowed sweetness of rhythm and metre, the depth of thought and
feeling, the vividness of imagery and the stimulating fervour of expression
which are the finest fruits of poetic power.&nbsp; On the other hand, many
sink almost into inanity beneath the burden of quibbles and conceits.&nbsp;
In both their excellences and their defects Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets
betray near kinship to his early dramatic work, in which passages of the
highest poetic temper at times alternate with unimpressive displays of
verbal jugglery.&nbsp; In phraseology the sonnets often closely resemble
such early dramatic efforts as &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost&rsquo; and &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is far more
concentration in the sonnets than in &lsquo;Venus and Adonis&rsquo; or in
&lsquo;Lucrece,&rsquo; although <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>occasional utterances of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Roman heroine show traces of the intensity that characterises the best of
them.&nbsp; The superior and more evenly sustained energy of the sonnets is
to be attributed, not to the accession of power that comes with increase of
years, but to the innate principles of the poetic form, and to metrical
exigencies, which impelled the sonnetteer to aim at a uniform condensation
of thought and language.</p>
<h3>Circulation in manuscript.</h3>
<p>In accordance with a custom that was not uncommon, Shakespeare did not
publish his sonnets; he circulated them in manuscript. <a
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88" class="citation">[88]</a>&nbsp;
But their reputation grew, and public interest was aroused in them in spite
of his <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>unreadiness to give them publicity.&nbsp; A line from one of
them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds (xciv. 14), <a

class="citation">[89a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>was quoted in the play of &lsquo;Edward III,&rsquo; which was probably
written before 1595.&nbsp; Meres, writing in 1598, enthusiastically
commends Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;sugred <a name="citation89b"></a><a
href="#footnote89b" class="citation">[89b]</a> sonnets among his private
friends,&rsquo; and mentions them in close conjunction with his two
narrative poems.&nbsp; William Jaggard piratically inserted in 1599 two of
the most mature of the series (Nos. cxxxviii. and cxliv.) in his
&lsquo;Passionate Pilgrim.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Their piratical publication in 1609.&nbsp; &lsquo;A Lover&rsquo;s
Complaint.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>At length, in 1609, the sonnets were surreptitiously sent to
press.&nbsp; Thomas Thorpe, the moving spirit in the design of their
publication, was a camp-follower of the regular publishing army.&nbsp; He
was professionally engaged in procuring for publication literary works
which had been widely disseminated in written copies, and had thus passed
beyond their authors&rsquo; control; for the law then recognised no natural
right in an author to the creations of his brain, and the full owner of a
manuscript copy of any literary composition was entitled to reproduce it,
or to treat it as he pleased, without <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>reference to the
author&rsquo;s wishes.&nbsp; Thorpe&rsquo;s career as a procurer of
neglected &lsquo;copy&rsquo; had begun well.&nbsp; He made, in 1600, his
earliest hit by bringing to light Marlowe&rsquo;s translation of the
&lsquo;First Book of Lucan.&rsquo;&nbsp; On May 20, 1609, he obtained a
license for the publication of &lsquo;Shakespeares Sonnets,&rsquo; and this
tradesman-like form of title figured not only on the
&lsquo;Stationers&rsquo; Company&rsquo;s Registers,&rsquo; but on the
title-page.&nbsp; Thorpe employed George Eld to print the manuscript, and
two booksellers, William Aspley and John Wright, to distribute it to the
public.&nbsp; On half the edition Aspley&rsquo;s name figured as that of
the seller, and on the other half that of Wright.&nbsp; The book was issued
in June, <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a> and the owner of the &lsquo;copy&rsquo; left the
public under no misapprehension as to his share in the production by
printing above his initials a dedicatory preface from his own pen.&nbsp;
The appearance in a book of a dedication from the publisher&rsquo;s
(instead of from the author&rsquo;s) pen was, unless the substitution was
specifically accounted for on other grounds, an accepted sign that the
author had no hand in the publication.&nbsp; Except in the case of his two
narrative poems, which were published in 1593 and 1594 respectively,
Shakespeare made no effort to publish any of his works, and uncomplainingly
submitted to the wholesale piracies of his plays and the ascription to him
of books by other hands.&nbsp; Such practices were encouraged by his
passive indifference and the contemporary condition of the law of
copyright.&nbsp; He <!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>cannot be credited with any responsibility for
the publication of Thorpe&rsquo;s collection of his sonnets in 1609.&nbsp;
With characteristic insolence Thorpe took the added liberty of appending a
previously unprinted poem of forty-nine seven-line stanzas (the metre of
&lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo;) entitled &lsquo;A Lover&rsquo;s Complaint,&rsquo; in
which a girl laments her betrayal by a deceitful youth.&nbsp; The poem, in
a gentle Spenserian vein, has no connection with the
&lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, as is possible, it be by Shakespeare, it
must have been written in very early days.</p>
<h3>Thomas Thorpe and &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>A misunderstanding respecting Thorpe&rsquo;s preface and his part in the
publication has led many critics into a serious misinterpretation of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s poems. <a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a>&nbsp; Thorpe&rsquo;s dedication was couched in
the bombastic language which was habitual to him.&nbsp; He advertised
Shakespeare as &lsquo;our ever-living poet.&rsquo;&nbsp; As the chief
promoter of the undertaking, he called himself &lsquo;the well-wishing
adventurer in setting forth,&rsquo; and in resonant phrase designated as
the patron of the venture <!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>a partner in the speculation, &lsquo;Mr. W.
H.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the conventional dedicatory formula of the day he wished
&lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; &lsquo;all happiness&rsquo; and
&lsquo;eternity,&rsquo; such eternity as Shakespeare in the text of the
sonnets conventionally foretold for his own verse.&nbsp; When Thorpe was
organising the issue of Marlowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;First Book of Lucan&rsquo;
in 1600, he sought the patronage of Edward Blount, a friend in the
trade.&nbsp; &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; was doubtless in a like position.&nbsp; He
is best identified with a stationer&rsquo;s assistant, William Hall, who
was professionally engaged, like Thorpe, in procuring
&lsquo;copy.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1606 &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; won a conspicuous
success in that direction, and conducted his operations under cover of the
familiar initials.&nbsp; In that year &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; announced that he
had procured a neglected manuscript poem&mdash;&lsquo;A Foure-fould
Meditation&rsquo;&mdash;by the Jesuit Robert Southwell who had been
executed in 1595, and he published it with a dedication (signed &lsquo;W.
H.&rsquo;) vaunting his good fortune in meeting with such
treasure-trove.&nbsp; When Thorpe dubbed &lsquo;Mr. W. H.,&rsquo; with
characteristic magniloquence, &lsquo;the onlie begetter [<i>i.e.</i>
obtainer or procurer] of these ensuing sonnets,&rsquo; he merely indicated
that that personage was the first of the pirate-publisher fraternity to
procure a manuscript of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets and recommend its
surreptitious issue.&nbsp; In accordance with custom, Thorpe gave
Hall&rsquo;s initials only, because he was an intimate associate who was
known by those initials to their common circle of friends.&nbsp; Hall was
not a man of sufficiently wide public reputation to render it probable that
the <!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>printing of his full name would excite additional interest in the
book or attract buyers.</p>
<p>The common assumption that Thorpe in this boastful preface was covertly
addressing, under the initials &lsquo;Mr. W. H.,&rsquo; a young nobleman,
to whom the sonnets were originally addressed by Shakespeare, ignores the
elementary principles of publishing transactions of the day, and especially
of those of the type to which Thorpe&rsquo;s efforts were confined. <a
name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a>&nbsp;
There was nothing mysterious or fantastic, although from a modern point of
view there was much that lacked principle, in Thorpe&rsquo;s methods of
business.&nbsp; His choice of patron for this, like all his volumes, was
dictated solely by his mercantile interests.&nbsp; He was under no
inducement and in no position to take into consideration the affairs of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s private life.&nbsp; Shakespeare, through all but the
earliest stages of his career, belonged socially to a world that was cut
off by impassable barriers from that in which Thorpe pursued <!-- page
94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>his
calling.&nbsp; It was wholly outside Thorpe&rsquo;s aims in life to seek to
mystify his customers by investing a dedication with any cryptic
significance.</p>
<p>No peer of the day, moreover, bore a name which could be represented by
the initials &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare was never on terms
of intimacy (although the contrary has often been recklessly assumed) with
William, third Earl of Pembroke, when a youth. <a name="citation94"></a><a
href="#footnote94" class="citation">[94]</a>&nbsp; But were complete proofs
of the acquaintanceship forthcoming, they would throw no light on
Thorpe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Earl of Pembroke was, from
his birth to the date of his succession to the earldom in 1601, known by
the courtesy title of Lord Herbert and by no other name, and he could not
have been designated at any period of his life by the symbols &lsquo;Mr. W.
H.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1609 Pembroke was a high officer of state, and numerous
books were dedicated to him in all the splendour of his many titles.&nbsp;
Star-Chamber penalties would have been exacted of any publisher or author
who denied him in print his titular distinctions.&nbsp; Thorpe had occasion
to dedicate two books to the earl in later years, and he there showed not
merely that he was fully acquainted with the compulsory etiquette, but that
his sycophantic temperament rendered him only eager to improve on the
conventional formulas of servility.&nbsp; Any further consideration of
Thorpe&rsquo;s address to &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; belongs to the <!-- page
95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>biographies of
Thorpe and his friend; it lies outside the scope of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
biography. <a name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a></p>
<h3>The form of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; ignore the somewhat complex
scheme of rhyme adopted by Petrarch, whom the Elizabethan sonnetteers, like
the French sonnetteers of the sixteenth century, recognised to be in most
respects their master.&nbsp; Following the example originally set by Surrey
and Wyatt, and generally pursued by Shakespeare&rsquo;s contemporaries, his
sonnets aim at far greater metrical simplicity than the Italian or the
French.&nbsp; They consist of three decasyllabic quatrains with a
concluding couplet, and the quatrains rhyme alternately. <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>A single sonnet does not always form an
independent poem.&nbsp; As in the French and Italian sonnets of the period,
and in those of Spenser, Sidney, Daniel, and Drayton, the same train of
thought is at times pursued continuously through two or more.&nbsp; The
collection of Shakespeare&rsquo;s 154 sonnets thus presents the appearance
of an extended series of independent poems, many in a varying number of
fourteen-line stanzas.&nbsp; The longest sequence (i.-xvii.) numbers
seventeen sonnets, and in Thorpe&rsquo;s edition opens the volume.</p>
<h3>Want of continuity.&nbsp; The two &lsquo;groups.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>It is unlikely that the order in which the poems were printed follows
the order in which they were written.&nbsp; Fantastic endeavours have been
made to detect in the original arrangement of the poems a closely connected
narrative, but the thread is on any showing constantly interrupted. <a
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp;
It is usual to divide the sonnets into two groups, and to represent that
all those numbered i.-cxxvi. by Thorpe were addressed to a young man, and
all those numbered cxxvii.-cliv. were <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>addressed to a
woman.&nbsp; This division cannot be literally justified.&nbsp; In the
first group some eighty of the sonnets can be proved to be addressed to a
man by the use of the masculine pronoun or some other unequivocal sign; but
among the remaining forty there is no clear indication of the kind.&nbsp;
Many of these forty are meditative soliloquies which address no person at
all (cf. cv. cxvi. cxix. cxxi.)&nbsp; A few invoke abstractions like Death
(lxvi.) or Time (cxxiii.), or &lsquo;benefit of ill&rsquo; (cxix.)&nbsp;
The twelve-lined poem (cxxvi.), the last of the first &lsquo;group,&rsquo;
does little more than sound a variation on the conventional poetic
invocations of Cupid or Love personified as a boy. <a
name="citation97"></a><a href="#footnote97" class="citation">[97]</a>&nbsp;
And there is no valid objection to the assumption that the poet inscribed
the rest of these forty sonnets to a woman (cf. xxi. xlvi. xlvii.)&nbsp;
Similarly, the sonnets in the second &lsquo;group&rsquo; (cxxvii.-cliv.)
have no uniform superscription.&nbsp; Six invoke no person at all.&nbsp;
No. cxxviii. is an overstrained compliment on a lady playing on the
virginals.&nbsp; No. cxxix. is a metaphysical disquisition on lust.&nbsp;
No. cxlv. is a playful lyric in <!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>octosyllabics, like Lyly&rsquo;s song of
&lsquo;Cupid and Campaspe,&rsquo; and its tone has close affinity to that
and other of Lyly&rsquo;s songs.&nbsp; No. cxlvi. invokes the soul of
man.&nbsp; Nos. cliii. and cliv. soliloquise on an ancient Greek apologue
on the force of Cupid&rsquo;s fire. <a name="citation98"></a><a
href="#footnote98" class="citation">[98]</a></p>
<h3>Main topics of the first &lsquo;group.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The choice and succession of topics in each &lsquo;group&rsquo; give to
neither genuine cohesion.&nbsp; In the first &lsquo;group&rsquo; the long
opening sequence (i.-xvii.) forms the poet&rsquo;s appeal to a young man to
marry so that his youth and beauty may survive in children.&nbsp; There is
almost a contradiction in terms between the poet&rsquo;s handling of that
topic and his emphatic boast in the two following sonnets (xviii.-xix.)
that his verse alone is fully equal to the task of immortalising his
friend&rsquo;s youth and accomplishments.&nbsp; The same asseveration is
repeated in many later sonnets (cf. lv. lx. lxiii. lxxiv. lxxxi. ci.
cvii.)&nbsp; These alternate with conventional adulation of the beauty of
the object of the poet&rsquo;s affections (cf. xxi. liii. lxviii.) and
descriptions of the effects of absence in intensifying devotion (cf.
xlviii. l. cxiii.)&nbsp; There are many reflections on the nocturnal
torments of a lover (cf. xxvii. xxviii. xliii. lxi.) and on his blindness
to the beauty of spring or summer when he is separated from his love (cf.
xcvii. xcviii.)&nbsp; At times a youth is rebuked for sensual indulgences;
he has sought and won the favour of the poet&rsquo;s mistress in the
poet&rsquo;s absence, but the poet is forgiving (xxxii.-xxxv. xl.-xlii.
lxix. xcv.-xcvi.)&nbsp; In Sonnet lxx. the young man whom <!-- page 99--><a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>the poet addresses is
credited with a different disposition and experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And thou present&rsquo;st a pure unstained prime.<br />
Thou hast pass&rsquo;d by the ambush of young days,<br />
Either not assail&rsquo;d, or victor being charg&rsquo;d!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At times melancholy overwhelms the writer: he despairs of the
corruptions of the age (lxvi.), reproaches himself with carnal sin (cxix.),
declares himself weary of his profession of acting (cxi. cxii.), and
foretells his approaching death (lxxi.-lxxiv.)&nbsp; Throughout are
dispersed obsequious addresses to the youth in his capacity of sole patron
of the poet&rsquo;s verse (cf. xxiii. xxxvii. c. ci. ciii. civ.)&nbsp; But
in one sequence the friend is sorrowfully reproved for bestowing his
patronage on rival poets (lxxviii.-lxxxvi.)&nbsp; In three sonnets near the
close of the first group in the original edition, the writer gives varied
assurances of his constancy in love or friendship which apply indifferently
to man or woman (cf. cxxii. cxxiv. cxxv.)</p>
<h3>Main topics of the second &lsquo;group.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In two sonnets of the second &lsquo;group&rsquo; (cxxvi.-clii.) the poet
compliments his mistress on her black complexion and raven-black hair and
eyes.&nbsp; In twelve sonnets he hotly denounces his &lsquo;dark&rsquo;
mistress for her proud disdain of his affection, and for her manifold
infidelities with other men.&nbsp; Apparently continuing a theme of the
first &lsquo;group,&rsquo; the poet rebukes the woman, whom he addresses,
for having beguiled his friend to yield himself to her seductions
(cxxxiii.-cxxxvi.)&nbsp; Elsewhere he makes satiric reflections on the
extravagant compliments paid to the fair sex by other sonnetteers (No.
cxxx.) <!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>or lightly quibbles on his name of &lsquo;Will&rsquo;
(cxxx.-vi.)&nbsp; In tone and subject-matter numerous sonnets in the second
as in the first &lsquo;group&rsquo; lack visible sign of coherence with
those they immediately precede or follow.</p>
<p>It is not merely a close study of the text that confutes the theory, for
which recent writers have fought hard, of a logical continuity in
Thorpe&rsquo;s arrangement of the poems in 1609.&nbsp; There remains the
historic fact that readers and publishers of the seventeenth century
acknowledged no sort of significance in the order in which the poems first
saw the light.&nbsp; When the sonnets were printed for a second time in
1640&mdash;thirty-one years after their first appearance&mdash;they were
presented in a completely different order.&nbsp; The short descriptive
titles which were then supplied to single sonnets or to short sequences
proved that the collection was regarded as a disconnected series of
occasional poems in more or less amorous vein.</p>
<h3>Lack of genuine sentiment in Elizabethan sonnets.&nbsp; Their
dependence on French and Italian models.</h3>
<p>In whatever order Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets be studied, the claim that
has been advanced in their behalf to rank as autobiographical documents can
only be accepted with many qualifications.&nbsp; Elizabethan sonnets were
commonly the artificial products of the poet&rsquo;s fancy.&nbsp; A strain
of personal emotion is occasionally discernible in a detached effort, and
is vaguely traceable in a few sequences; but autobiographical confessions
were very rarely the stuff of which the Elizabethan sonnet was made.&nbsp;
The typical collection <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>of Elizabethan sonnets was a mosaic of
plagiarisms, a medley of imitative studies.&nbsp; Echoes of the French or
of the Italian sonnetteers, with their Platonic idealism, are usually the
dominant notes.&nbsp; The echoes often have a musical quality peculiar to
themselves.&nbsp; Daniel&rsquo;s fine sonnet (xlix.) on
&lsquo;Care-charmer, sleep,&rsquo; although directly inspired by the
French, breathes a finer melody than the sonnet of Pierre de Brach <a
name="citation101a"></a><a href="#footnote101a" class="citation">[101a]</a>
apostrophising &lsquo;le sommeil chasse-soin&rsquo; (in the collection
entitled &lsquo;Les Amours d&rsquo;Aym&eacute;e&rsquo;), or the sonnet of
Philippe Desportes invoking &lsquo;Sommeil, paisible fils de la nuit
solitaire&rsquo; (in the collection entitled &lsquo;Amours
d&rsquo;Hippolyte&rsquo;). <a name="citation101b"></a><a
href="#footnote101b" class="citation">[101b]</a>&nbsp; But, throughout
Elizabethan sonnet literature, the heavy debt to Italian and French effort
is unmistakable. <a name="citation101c"></a><a href="#footnote101c"
class="citation">[101c]</a>&nbsp; Spenser, in 1569, at the outset of his
literary career, avowedly translated numerous sonnets from Du Bellay and
from Petrarch, and his friend Gabriel Harvey bestowed on him the title of
&lsquo;an English Petrarch&rsquo;&mdash;the highest praise that the critic
conceived it possible to bestow on an English sonnetteer. <a
name="citation101d"></a><a href="#footnote101d"
class="citation">[101d]</a>&nbsp; Thomas Watson in 1582, in his <!-- page
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>collection
of metrically irregular sonnets which he entitled
&lsquo;&#904;&Kappa;&Alpha;&Tau;&Omicron;&Mu;&Pi;&Alpha;&Theta;&Iota;&Alpha;,
or A Passionate Century of Love,&rsquo; prefaced each poem, which he termed
a &lsquo;passion,&rsquo; with a prose note of its origin and
intention.&nbsp; Watson frankly informed his readers that one
&lsquo;passion&rsquo; was &lsquo;wholly translated out of Petrarch;&rsquo;
that in another passion &lsquo;he did very busily imitate and augment a
certain ode of Ronsard;&rsquo; while &lsquo;the sense or matter of &ldquo;a
third&rdquo; was taken out of Serafino in his
&ldquo;Strambotti.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; In every case Watson gave the exact
reference to his <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>foreign original, and frequently appended a
quotation. <a name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a>&nbsp; Drayton in 1594, in the dedicatory sonnet
of his collection of sonnets entitled &lsquo;Idea,&rsquo; declared that it
was &lsquo;a fault too common in this latter time&rsquo; &lsquo;to filch
from Desportes or from Petrarch&rsquo;s pen.&rsquo; <a
name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a>&nbsp; Lodge did not acknowledge his borrowings
more specifically than his colleagues, but he made a plain profession of
indebtedness to Desportes when he wrote: &lsquo;Few men are able to second
the sweet conceits of Philippe Desportes, whose poetical writings are
ordinarily in everybody&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo; <a name="citation103c"></a><a
href="#footnote103c" class="citation">[103c]</a>&nbsp; Giles Fletcher, who
in his collection of sonnets called &lsquo;Licia&rsquo; (1593) simulated
the varying <!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>moods of a lover under the sway of a great passion as
successfully as most of his rivals, stated on his title-page that his poems
were all written in &lsquo;imitation of the best Latin poets and
others.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very many of the love-sonnets in the series of
sixty-eight penned ten years later by William Drummond of Hawthornden have
been traced to their sources in the Italian sonnets not merely of Petrarch,
but of the sixteenth-century poets Guarini, Bembo, Giovanni Battista
Marino, Tasso, and Sannazzaro. <a name="citation104a"></a><a
href="#footnote104a" class="citation">[104a]</a>&nbsp; The Elizabethans
usually gave the fictitious mistresses after whom their volumes of sonnets
were called the names that had recently served the like purpose in
France.&nbsp; Daniel followed Maurice S&egrave;ve <a
name="citation104b"></a><a href="#footnote104b" class="citation">[104b]</a>
in christening his collection &lsquo;Delia;&rsquo; Constable followed
Desportes in christening his collection &lsquo;Diana;&rsquo; while Drayton
not only applied to his sonnets on his title-page in 1594 the French term
&lsquo;amours,&rsquo; but bestowed on his imaginary heroine the title of
Idea, which seems to have been the invention of Claude de Pontoux, <a
name="citation104c"></a><a href="#footnote104c" class="citation">[104c]</a>
although it was employed by other French contemporaries.</p>
<h3>Sonnetteers&rsquo; admission of insincerity.</h3>
<p>With good reason Sir Philip Sidney warned the public that &lsquo;no
inward touch&rsquo; was to be expected from sonnetteers of his day, whom he
describes as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;[Men] that do dictionary&rsquo;s method bring<br />
Into their rhymes running in rattling rows;<br />
[Men] that poor Petrarch&rsquo;s long deceas&egrave;d woes<br />
With newborn sighs and denizened wit do sing.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>Sidney unconvincingly claimed greater sincerity for his own
experiments.&nbsp; But &lsquo;even amorous sonnets in the gallantest and
sweetest civil vein,&rsquo; wrote Gabriel Harvey in &lsquo;Pierces
Supererogation&rsquo; in 1593, &lsquo;are but dainties of a pleasurable
wit.&rsquo;&nbsp; Drayton&rsquo;s sonnets more nearly approached
Shakespeare&rsquo;s in quality than those of any contemporary.&nbsp; Yet
Drayton told the readers of his collection entitled &lsquo;Idea&rsquo; <a
name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105" class="citation">[105]</a>
(after the French) that if any sought genuine passion in them, they had
better go elsewhere.&nbsp; &lsquo;In all humours <i>sportively</i> he
ranged,&rsquo; he declared.&nbsp; Giles Fletcher, in 1593, introduced his
collection of imitative sonnets entitled &lsquo;Licia, or Poems of
Love,&rsquo; with the warning, &lsquo;Now in that I have written love
sonnets, if any man measure my affection by my style, let him say I am in
love. . . .&nbsp; Here, take this by the way . . . a man may write of love
and not be in love, as well as of <!-- page 106--><a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>husbandry and not go
to the plough, or of witches and be none, or of holiness and be
profane.&rsquo; <a name="citation106a"></a><a href="#footnote106a"
class="citation">[106a]</a></p>
<h3>Contemporary censure of sonnetteers&rsquo; false sentiment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Gulling Sonnets.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The dissemination of false sentiment by the sonnetteers, and their
monotonous and mechanical treatment of &lsquo;the pangs of despised
love&rsquo; or the joys of requited affection, did not escape the censure
of contemporary criticism.&nbsp; The air soon rang with sarcastic protests
from the most respected writers of the day.&nbsp; In early life Gabriel
Harvey wittily parodied the mingling of adulation and vituperation in the
conventional sonnet-sequence in his &lsquo;Amorous Odious Sonnet intituled
The Student&rsquo;s Loove or Hatrid.&rsquo; <a name="citation106b"></a><a
href="#footnote106b" class="citation">[106b]</a>&nbsp; Chapman in 1595, in
a series of sonnets entitled &lsquo;A Coronet for his mistress
Philosophy,&rsquo; appealed to his literary comrades to abandon &lsquo;the
painted cabinet&rsquo; of the love-sonnet for a coffer of genuine
worth.&nbsp; But the most resolute of the censors of the sonnetteering
vogue was the poet and lawyer, Sir John Davies.&nbsp; In a sonnet addressed
about 1596 to his friend, Sir Anthony Cooke (the patron of Drayton&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Idea&rsquo;), he inveighed against the &lsquo;bastard sonnets&rsquo;
which &lsquo;base rhymers&rsquo; &lsquo;daily&rsquo; begot &lsquo;to their
own shames and poetry&rsquo;s disgrace.&rsquo;&nbsp; In his anxiety to
stamp out the folly he wrote and circulated in manuscript a specimen series
of nine &lsquo;gulling sonnets&rsquo; <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>or parodies of the
conventional efforts. <a name="citation107a"></a><a href="#footnote107a"
class="citation">[107a]</a>&nbsp; Even Shakespeare does not seem to have
escaped Davies&rsquo;s condemnation.&nbsp; Sir John is especially severe on
the sonnetteers who handled conceits based on legal technicalities, and his
eighth &lsquo;gulling sonnet,&rsquo; in which he ridicules the application
of law terms to affairs of the heart, may well have been suggested by
Shakespeare&rsquo;s legal phraseology in his Sonnets lxxxvii. and cxxiv.;
<a name="citation107b"></a><a href="#footnote107b"
class="citation">[107b]</a> while Davies&rsquo;s Sonnet ix., beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;To love, my lord, I do knight&rsquo;s service owe&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>must have parodied Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnet xxvi., beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage,&rsquo; etc. <a

<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s scornful allusion to sonnets in his plays.</h3>
<p>Echoes of the critical hostility are heard, it is curious to note, in
nearly all the references that Shakespeare himself makes to sonnetteering
in his plays.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tush, none but minstrels like of
sonnetting,&rsquo; exclaims Biron in &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost&rsquo; (IV. iii. 158).&nbsp; In the &lsquo;Two Gentlemen of
Verona&rsquo; (III. ii. 68 seq.) there is a satiric touch in the recipe for
the conventional love-sonnet which Proteus offers the amorous Duke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must lay lime to tangle her desires<br />
By wailful sonnets whose compos&egrave;d rime<br />
<!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>Should be full fraught with serviceable vows . . .<br />
Say that upon the altar of her beauty<br />
You sacrifice your sighs, your tears, your heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercutio treats Elizabethan sonnetteers even less respectfully when
alluding to them in his flouts at Romeo: &lsquo;Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen-wench.&nbsp;
Marry, she had a better love to be-rhyme her.&rsquo; <a
name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a>&nbsp; In later plays Shakespeare&rsquo;s disdain
of the sonnet is still more pronounced.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo;
(III. vii. 33 et seq.) the Dauphin, after bestowing ridiculously
magniloquent commendation on his charger, remarks, &lsquo;I once writ a
sonnet in his praise, and begun thus: &ldquo;Wonder of
nature!&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; The Duke of Orleans retorts: &lsquo;I have
heard a sonnet begin so to one&rsquo;s mistress.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Dauphin
replies: &lsquo;Then did they imitate that which I composed to my courser;
for my horse is my mistress.&rsquo;&nbsp; In &lsquo;Much Ado about
Nothing&rsquo; (V. ii. 4-7) Margaret, Hero&rsquo;s waiting-woman, mockingly
asks Benedick to &lsquo;write her a sonnet in praise of her
beauty.&rsquo;&nbsp; Benedick jestingly promises one so &lsquo;in high a
style that no man living shall come over it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Subsequently (V.
iv. 87) Benedick is convicted, to the amusement of his friends, of penning
&lsquo;a halting sonnet of his own pure brain&rsquo; in praise of
Beatrice.</p>

109</span>VIII&mdash;THE BORROWED CONCEITS OF THE SONNETS</h2>
<h3>Slender autobiographical element in Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets.&nbsp;
The imitative element.</h3>
<p>At a first glance a far larger proportion of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets
give the reader the illusion of personal confessions than those of any
contemporary, but when allowance has been made for the current conventions
of Elizabethan sonnetteering, as well as for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
unapproached affluence in dramatic instinct and invention&mdash;an
affluence which enabled him to identify himself with every phase of
emotion&mdash;the autobiographic element in his sonnets, although it may
not be dismissed altogether, is seen to shrink to slender
proportions.&nbsp; As soon as the collection is studied comparatively with
the many thousand sonnets that the printing presses of England, France, and
Italy poured forth during the last years of the sixteenth century, a vast
number of Shakespeare&rsquo;s performances prove to be little more than
professional trials of skill, often of superlative merit, to which he
deemed himself challenged by the efforts of contemporary
practitioners.&nbsp; The thoughts and words of the sonnets of Daniel,
Drayton, Watson, Barnabe Barnes, Constable, and Sidney were assimilated by
Shakespeare in his poems as consciously and <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>with as little
compunction as the plays and novels of contemporaries in his dramatic
work.&nbsp; To Drayton he was especially indebted. <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a>&nbsp; Such resemblances as are visible between
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets and those of Petrarch or Desportes seem due to
his study of the English imitators of those sonnetteers.&nbsp; Most of <!--
page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Ronsard&rsquo;s nine hundred sonnets and many of his numerous
odes were accessible to Shakespeare in English adaptations, but there are a
few signs that Shakespeare had recourse to Ronsard direct.</p>
<p>Adapted or imitated conceits are scattered over the whole of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s collection.&nbsp; They are usually manipulated with
consummate skill, but Shakespeare&rsquo;s indebtedness is not thereby
obscured.&nbsp; Shakespeare in many beautiful sonnets describes spring and
summer, night and sleep and their influence on amorous emotion.&nbsp; Such
topics are common themes of the poetry of the Renaissance, and they figure
in Shakespeare&rsquo;s pages clad in the identical livery that clothed them
in the sonnets of Petrarch, Ronsard, De Ba&iuml;f, and Desportes, or of
English disciples of the Italian and French masters. <a
name="citation111"></a><a href="#footnote111"
class="citation">[111]</a>&nbsp; In <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Sonnet xxiv.
Shakespeare develops Ronsard&rsquo;s conceit that his love&rsquo;s portrait
is painted on his heart; and in Sonnet cxxii. he repeats something of
Ronsard&rsquo;s phraseology in describing how his friend, who has just made
him a gift of &lsquo;tables,&rsquo; is &lsquo;character&rsquo;d&rsquo; in
his brain. <a name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a>&nbsp; Sonnet xcix., which reproaches the
flowers with stealing their charms from the features of his love, is
adapted from Constable&rsquo;s sonnet to Diana (No. ix.), and may be
matched in other collections.&nbsp; Elsewhere Shakespeare meditates on the
theory that man is an amalgam of the four elements, earth, water, air, and
fire (xl.-xlv.) <a name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b"
class="citation">[112b]</a>&nbsp; In all these he reproduces, with such
embellishments as his genius dictated, phrases and sentiments of Daniel,
Drayton, Barnes, and Watson, who imported them direct from France and
Italy.&nbsp; In two or three instances Shakespeare showed his reader that
he was engaged in a mere literary exercise by offering him alternative
renderings of the same conventional conceit.&nbsp; In Sonnets xlvi. and
xlvii. he paraphrases twice over&mdash;appropriating many of Watson&rsquo;s
words&mdash;the unexhilarating notion that the eye and heart are in
perpetual dispute as to which has the greater influence on <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>lovers. <a
name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a"
class="citation">[113a]</a>&nbsp; In the concluding sonnets, cliii. and
cliv., he gives alternative versions of an apologue illustrating the
potency of love which first figured in the Greek anthology, had been
translated into Latin, and subsequently won the notice of English, French,
and Italian sonnetteers. <a name="citation113b"></a><a href="#footnote113b"
class="citation">[113b]</a></p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s claims of immortality for his sonnets a borrowed
conceit.</h3>
<p>In the numerous sonnets in which Shakespeare boasted that his verse was
so certain of immortality that it was capable of immortalising the person
to whom it was addressed, he gave voice to no conviction that was peculiar
to his mental constitution, to no involuntary exaltation of spirit, or
spontaneous <!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>ebullition of feeling.&nbsp; He was merely proving that he could
at will, and with superior effect, handle a theme that Ronsard and
Desportes, emulating Pindar, Horace, Ovid, and other classical poets, had
lately made a commonplace of the poetry of Europe. <a
name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a>&nbsp; Sir Philip Sidney, in his &lsquo;Apologie
for Poetrie&rsquo; (1595) wrote that it was the common habit of poets to
tell you that they will make you immortal by their verses. <a
name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b"
class="citation">[114b]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Men of great calling,&rsquo; Nash
wrote in his &lsquo;Pierce Pennilesse,&rsquo; 1593, &lsquo;take it of merit
to have their names eternised by poets.&rsquo; <a
name="citation114c"></a><a href="#footnote114c"
class="citation">[114c]</a>&nbsp; In the hands of Elizabethan sonnetteers
the &lsquo;eternising&rsquo; faculty of their <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>verse became a staple
and indeed an inevitable topic.&nbsp; Spenser wrote in his
&lsquo;Amoretti&rsquo; (1595, Sonnet lxxv.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My verse your virtues rare shall eternize,<br />
And in the heavens write your glorious name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drayton and Daniel developed the conceit with unblushing
iteration.&nbsp; Drayton, who spoke of his efforts as &lsquo;my immortal
song&rsquo; (<i>Idea</i>, vi. 14) and &lsquo;my world-out-wearing
rhymes&rsquo; (xliv. 7), embodied the vaunt in such lines as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While thus my pen strives to eternize thee (<i>Idea</i> xliv. 1).<br />
Ensuing ages yet my rhymes shall cherish (<i>ib.</i> xliv. 11).<br />
My name shall mount unto eternity (<i>ib.</i> xliv. 14).<br />
All that I seek is to eternize thee (<i>ib.</i> xlvii. 54).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daniel was no less explicit</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This [<i>sc.</i> verse] may remain thy lasting monument (<i>Delia</i>,
xxxvii. 9).<br />
Thou mayst in after ages live esteemed,<br />
Unburied in these lines (<i>ib.</i> xxxix. 9-10).<br />
These [<i>sc.</i> my verses] are the arks, the trophies I erect<br />
That fortify thy name against old age;<br />
And these [<i>sc.</i> verses] thy sacred virtues must protect<br />
Against the dark and time&rsquo;s consuming rage (<i>ib.</i> l. 9-12).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conceits in sonnets addressed to a woman.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare, in his references to his &lsquo;eternal lines&rsquo;
(xviii. 12) and in the assurances that he gives the subject of his
addresses that the sonnets are, in Daniel&rsquo;s exact phrase, his
&lsquo;monument&rsquo; (lxxxi. 9, cvii. 13), was merely accommodating
himself to the prevailing taste.&nbsp; Characteristically in Sonnet lv. he
invested the topic with a splendour that was not approached by any other
poet: <a name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>Not marble, nor the gilded monuments<br />
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; <a name="citation116"></a><a
href="#footnote116" class="citation">[116]</a><br />
But you shall shine more bright in these contents<br />
Than unswept stone besmear&rsquo;d with sluttish time.<br />
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<br />
And broils root out the work of masonry,<br />
Nor Mars his sword nor war&rsquo;s quick fire shall burn<br />
The living record of your memory.<br />
&lsquo;Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity<br />
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room<br />
Even in the eyes of all posterity<br />
That wear this world out to the ending doom.<br />
&nbsp;  So, till the judgement that yourself arise,<br />
&nbsp;  You live in this, and dwell in lovers&rsquo; eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The imitative element is no less conspicuous in the sonnets that
Shakespeare distinctively addresses <!-- page 117--><a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>to a woman.&nbsp; In
two of the latter (cxxxv.-vi.), where he quibbles over the fact of the
identity of his own name of Will with a lady&rsquo;s &lsquo;will&rsquo;
(the synonym in Elizabethan English of both &lsquo;lust&rsquo; and
&lsquo;obstinacy&rsquo;), he derisively challenges comparison with
wire-drawn conceits of rival sonnetteers, especially of Barnabe Barnes, who
had enlarged on his disdainful mistress&rsquo;s &lsquo;wills,&rsquo; and
had turned the word &lsquo;grace&rsquo; to the same punning account as
Shakespeare <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>turned the word &lsquo;will.&rsquo; <a name="citation118a"></a><a
href="#footnote118a" class="citation">[118a]</a>&nbsp; Similarly in Sonnet
cxxx. beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My mistress&rsquo; eyes are nothing like the sun;<br />
Coral is far more red than her lips&rsquo; red . . .<br />
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head, <a
name="citation118b"></a><a href="#footnote118b"
class="citation">[118b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>he satirises the conventional lists of precious stones, metals, and
flowers, to which the sonnetteers likened their mistresses&rsquo;
features.</p>
<h3>The praise of &lsquo;blackness.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In two sonnets (cxxvii. and cxxxii.) Shakespeare amiably notices the
black complexion, hair, and eyes of his mistress, and expresses a
preference for features of that hue over those of the fair hue which was,
he tells us, more often associated in poetry with beauty.&nbsp; He commends
the &lsquo;dark lady&rsquo; for refusing to practise those arts by which
other women of the day gave their hair and faces colours denied them by
Nature.&nbsp; Here Shakespeare repeats almost verbatim his own lines in
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo;(IV. iii. 241-7), where the
heroine Rosaline is described as &lsquo;black as ebony,&rsquo; with
&lsquo;brows decked in black,&rsquo; and in &lsquo;mourning&rsquo; for <!--
page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>her
fashionable sisters&rsquo; indulgence in the disguising arts of the
toilet.&nbsp; &lsquo;No face is fair that is not full so black,&rsquo;
exclaims Rosaline&rsquo;s lover.&nbsp; But neither in the sonnets nor in
the play can Shakespeare&rsquo;s praise of &lsquo;blackness&rsquo; claim
the merit of being his own invention.&nbsp; Sir Philip Sidney, in sonnet
vii. of his &lsquo;Astrophel and Stella,&rsquo; had anticipated it.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;beams&rsquo; of the eyes of Sidney&rsquo;s mistress were
&lsquo;wrapt in colour black&rsquo; and wore &lsquo;this mourning
weed,&rsquo; so</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That whereas black seems beauty&rsquo;s contrary,<br />
She even in black doth make all beauties flow. <a
name="citation119a"></a><a href="#footnote119a"
class="citation">[119a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To his praise of &lsquo;blackness&rsquo; in &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo; Shakespeare appends a playful but caustic
comment on the paradox that he detects in the conceit. <a
name="citation119b"></a><a href="#footnote119b"
class="citation">[119b]</a>&nbsp; Similarly, the sonnets, in which a dark
complexion is pronounced to be a mark of beauty, are followed by others in
which the poet argues in self-confutation that blackness of feature is
hideous in a woman, and invariably indicates moral turpitude or blackness
of heart.&nbsp; Twice, in much the same language as had already served a
like purpose in the play, does <!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>he mock his &lsquo;dark lady&rsquo; with this
uncomplimentary interpretation of dark-coloured hair and eyes.</p>
<h3>The sonnets of vituperation.</h3>
<p>The two sonnets, in which this view of &lsquo;blackness&rsquo; is
developed, form part of a series of twelve, which belongs to a special
category of sonnetteering effort.&nbsp; In them Shakespeare abandons the
sugared sentiment which characterises most of his hundred and forty-two
remaining sonnets.&nbsp; He grows vituperative and pours a volley of
passionate abuse upon a woman whom he represents as disdaining his
advances.&nbsp; The genuine anguish of a rejected lover often expresses
itself in curses both loud and deep, but the mood of blinding wrath which
the rejection of a lovesuit may rouse in a passionate nature does not seem
from the internal evidence to be reflected genuinely in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets of vituperation.&nbsp; It was inherent in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
genius that he should import more dramatic intensity than any other poet
into sonnets of a vituperative type; but there is also in his vituperative
sonnets a declamatory parade of figurative extravagance which suggests that
the emotion is feigned and that the poet is striking an attitude.&nbsp; He
cannot have been in earnest in seeking to conciliate his disdainful
mistress&mdash;a result at which the vituperative sonnets purport to
aim&mdash;when he tells her that she is &lsquo;black as hell, as dark as
night,&rsquo; and with &lsquo;so foul a face&rsquo; is &lsquo;the bay where
all men ride.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Gabriel Harvey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Amorous Odious Sonnet.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>But external evidence is more conclusive as to the artificial
construction of the vituperative sonnets.&nbsp; Again a comparison of this
series with the efforts of the modish sonnetteers assigns to it its true
character.&nbsp; <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>Every sonnetteer of the sixteenth century, at
some point in his career, devoted his energies to vituperation of a cruel
siren.&nbsp; Ronsard in his sonnets celebrated in language quite as furious
as Shakespeare&rsquo;s a &lsquo;fierce tigress,&rsquo; a
&lsquo;murderess,&rsquo; a &lsquo;Medusa.&rsquo;&nbsp; Barnabe Barnes
affected to contend in his sonnets with a female &lsquo;tyrant,&rsquo; a
&lsquo;Medusa,&rsquo; a &lsquo;rock.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Women&rsquo;
(Barnes laments) &lsquo;are by nature proud as devils.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
monotonous and artificial regularity with which the sonnetteers sounded the
vituperative stop, whenever they had exhausted their notes of adulation,
excited ridicule in both England and France.&nbsp; In Shakespeare&rsquo;s
early life the convention was wittily parodied by Gabriel Harvey in
&lsquo;An Amorous Odious sonnet intituled The Student&rsquo;s Loove or
Hatrid, or both or neither, or what shall please the looving or hating
reader, either in sport or earnest, to make of such contrary passions as
are here discoursed.&rsquo; <a name="citation121"></a><a
href="#footnote121" class="citation">[121]</a>&nbsp; After extolling the
beauty and virtue of his mistress above that of Aretino&rsquo;s Angelica,
Petrarch&rsquo;s Laura, Catullus&rsquo;s Lesbia, and eight other far-famed
objects of poetic adoration, Harvey suddenly denounces her in burlesque
rhyme as &lsquo;a serpent in brood,&rsquo; &lsquo;a poisonous toad,&rsquo;
&lsquo;a heart of marble,&rsquo; and &lsquo;a stony mind as passionless as
a block.&rsquo;&nbsp; Finally he tells her,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If ever there were she-devils incarnate,<br />
They are altogether in thee incorporate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Jodelle&rsquo;s &lsquo;Contr&rsquo; Amours.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In France Etienne Jodelle, a professional <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>sonnetteer although
he is best known as a dramatist, made late in the second half of the
sixteenth century an independent endeavour of like kind to stifle by means
of parody the vogue of the vituperative sonnet.&nbsp; Jodelle designed a
collection of three hundred sonnets which he inscribed to &lsquo;hate of a
woman,&rsquo; and he appropriately entitled them &lsquo;Contr&rsquo;
Amours&rsquo; in distinction from &lsquo;Amours,&rsquo; the term applied to
sonnets in the honeyed vein.&nbsp; Only seven of Jodelle&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Contr&rsquo; Amours&rsquo; are extant, but there is sufficient
identity of tone between them and Shakespeare&rsquo;s vituperative efforts
almost to discover in Shakespeare&rsquo;s invectives a spark of
Jodelle&rsquo;s satiric fire. <a name="citation122"></a><a
href="#footnote122" class="citation">[122]</a>&nbsp; The dark lady <!--
page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;sonnets&rsquo; may therefore be relegated to the
ranks of the creatures of his fancy.&nbsp; It is quite possible that he may
have met in real life a dark-complexioned siren, and it is possible that he
may have fared ill at her disdainful hands.&nbsp; But no such incident is
needed to account for the presence of &lsquo;the dark lady&rsquo; in the
sonnets.&nbsp; It was the exacting conventions of the sonnetteering
contagion, and not his personal experiences or emotions, that impelled
Shakespeare to give &lsquo;the dark lady&rsquo; of his sonnets a poetic
being. <a name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123"
class="citation">[123]</a>&nbsp; She has been compared, not very justly,
with Shakespeare&rsquo;s splendid creation of Cleopatra in his play of <!--
page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>&lsquo;Antony and Cleopatra.&rsquo;&nbsp; From one point of view
the same criticism may be passed on both.&nbsp; There is no greater and no
less ground for seeking in Shakespeare&rsquo;s personal environment the
original of &lsquo;the dark lady&rsquo; of his sonnets than for seeking
there the original of his Queen of Egypt.</p>
<h2><!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>IX&mdash;THE PATRONAGE OF THE EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON</h2>
<h3>Biographic fact in the &lsquo;dedicatory&rsquo; sonnets.</h3>
<p>Amid the borrowed conceits and poetic figures of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets there lurk suggestive references to the circumstances in his
external life that attended their composition.&nbsp; If few can be safely
regarded as autobiographic revelations of sentiment, many of them offer
evidence of the relations in which he stood to a patron, and to the
position that he sought to fill in the circle of that patron&rsquo;s
literary retainers.&nbsp; Twenty sonnets, which may for purposes of
exposition be entitled &lsquo;dedicatory&rsquo; sonnets, are addressed to
one who is declared without periphrasis and without disguise to be a patron
of the poet&rsquo;s verse (Nos. xxiii., xxvi., xxxii., xxxvii., xxxviii.,
lxix., lxxvii.-lxxxvi., c., ci., cvi.)&nbsp; In one of these&mdash;Sonnet
lxxviii.&mdash;Shakespeare asserted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse<br />
And found such fair assistance in my verse<br />
As every alien pen hath got my use<br />
And under thee their poesy disperse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently he regretfully pointed out how his patron&rsquo;s readiness
to accept the homage of other <!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>poets seemed to be thrusting him from the
enviable place of pre-eminence in his patron&rsquo;s esteem.</p>
<h3>The Earl of Southampton the poet&rsquo;s sole patron.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s biographer is under an obligation to attempt an
identification of the persons whose relations with the poet are defined so
explicitly.&nbsp; The problem presented by the patron is simple.&nbsp;
Shakespeare states unequivocally that he has no patron but one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sing [<i>sc.</i> O Muse!] to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,<br />
And gives thy pen both skill and argument (c. 7-8).<br />
For to no other pass my verses tend<br />
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell (ciii. 11-12).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Earl of Southampton, the patron of his narrative poems, is the only
patron of Shakespeare that is known to biographical research.&nbsp; No
contemporary document or tradition gives the faintest suggestion that
Shakespeare was the friend or dependent of any other man of rank.&nbsp; A
trustworthy tradition corroborates the testimony respecting
Shakespeare&rsquo;s close intimacy with the Earl that is given in the
dedicatory epistles of his &lsquo;Venus and Adonis&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo;, penned respectively in 1593 and 1594.&nbsp;
According to Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare&rsquo;s first adequate biographer,
&lsquo;there is one instance so singular in its magnificence of this patron
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s that if I had not been assured that the story was
handed down by Sir William D&rsquo;Avenant, who was probably very well
acquainted with his affairs, I should not venture to have inserted; that my
Lord Southampton at one time gave him a thousand pounds to enable him to go
through with a purchase which he heard he had a <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>mind to.&nbsp; A
bounty very great and very rare at any time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is no difficulty in detecting the lineaments of the Earl of
Southampton in those of the man who is distinctively greeted in the sonnets
as the poet&rsquo;s patron.&nbsp; Three of the twenty
&lsquo;dedicatory&rsquo; sonnets merely translate into the language of
poetry the expressions of devotion which had already done duty in the
dedicatory epistle in prose that prefaces &lsquo;Lucrece.&rsquo;&nbsp; That
epistle to Southampton runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The love <a name="citation127"></a><a href="#footnote127"
class="citation">[127]</a> I dedicate to your lordship is without end;
whereof this pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous
moiety.&nbsp; The warrant I have of your honourable disposition, not the
worth of my untutored lines, makes it assured of acceptance.&nbsp; What I
have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have,
devoted yours.&nbsp; Were my worth greater, my duty would show greater;
meantime, as it is, it is bound to your lordship, to whom I wish long life,
still lengthened with all happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">Your lordship&rsquo;s in all duty,<br />
<span class="smcap">William Shakespeare</span>.</p>
<p>Sonnet xxvi. is a gorgeous rendering of these sentences:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

&nbsp;  Till then not show my head where thou may&rsquo;st prove me. <a
name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128"
class="citation">[128]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; epistle&rsquo;s intimation that the
patron&rsquo;s love alone gives value to the poet&rsquo;s &lsquo;untutored
lines&rsquo; is repeated in Sonnet xxxii., which doubtless reflected a
moment of depression:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If thou survive my well-contented day,<br />
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,<br />
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey<br />
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,<br />
Compare them with the bettering of the time,<br />
And though they be outstripp&rsquo;d by every pen,<br />
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,<br />
Exceeded by the height of happier men.<br />
<!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>O,
then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:<br />
&lsquo;Had my friend&rsquo;s Muse grown with this growing age,<br />
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,<br />
To march in ranks of better equipage; <a name="citation129"></a><a
href="#footnote129" class="citation">[129]</a><br />
&nbsp;  But since he died and poets better prove,<br />
&nbsp;  Theirs for their style I&rsquo;ll read, his for his
love.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A like vein is pursued in greater exaltation of spirit in Sonnet
xxxviii.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can my Muse want subject to invent,<br />
While thou dost breathe, that pour&rsquo;st into my verse<br />
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent<br />
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?<br />
O give thyself the thanks, if aught in me<br />
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;<br />
For who&rsquo;s so dumb that cannot write to thee,<br />
When thou thyself dost give invention light?<br />
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth<br />
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;<br />
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth<br />
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.<br />
&nbsp;  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,<br />
&nbsp;  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The central conceit here so finely developed&mdash;that the patron may
claim as his own handiwork the <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s</i> verse
because he inspires it&mdash;belongs to the most conventional schemes of
dedicatory adulation.&nbsp; When Daniel, in 1592, inscribed his volume of
sonnets <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>entitled &lsquo;Delia&rsquo; to the Countess of Pembroke, he
played in the prefatory sonnet on the same note, and used in the concluding
couplet almost the same words as Shakespeare.&nbsp; Daniel wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great patroness of these my humble rhymes,<br />
Which thou from out thy greatness dost inspire . . .<br />
O leave [<i>i.e.</i> cease] not still to grace thy work in me . . .<br />
Whereof the travail I may challenge mine,<br />
But yet the glory, madam, must be thine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere in the Sonnets we hear fainter echoes of the
&lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; epistle.&nbsp; Repeatedly does the sonnetteer renew
the assurance given there that his patron is &lsquo;part of all&rsquo; he
has or is.&nbsp; Frequently do we meet in the Sonnets with such expressions
as these:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I] by a <i>part of all</i> your glory live (xxxvii. 12);<br />
Thou art <i>all the better part of me</i> (xxxix. 2);<br />
My spirit is thine, <i>the better part of me</i> (lxxiv. 8);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while &lsquo;the love without end&rsquo; which Shakespeare had vowed to
Southampton in the light of day reappears in sonnets addressed to the youth
as &lsquo;eternal love&rsquo; (cviii. 9), and a devotion &lsquo;what shall
have no end&rsquo; (cx. 9).</p>
<h3>Rivals in Southampton&rsquo;s favour.</h3>
<p>The identification of the rival poets whose &lsquo;richly
compiled&rsquo; &lsquo;comments&rsquo; of his patron&rsquo;s
&lsquo;praise&rsquo; excited Shakespeare&rsquo;s jealousy is a more
difficult inquiry than the identification of the patron.&nbsp; The rival
poets with their &lsquo;precious phrase by all the Muses filed&rsquo;
(lxxxv. 4) must be sought among the writers who eulogised Southampton and
are known to have shared his patronage.&nbsp; The field of choice is not
small.&nbsp; Southampton from boyhood cultivated literature and the society
of <!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>literary men.&nbsp; In 1594 no nobleman received so abundant a
measure of adulation from the contemporary world of letters. <a
name="citation131a"></a><a href="#footnote131a"
class="citation">[131a]</a>&nbsp; Thomas Nash justly described the Earl,
when dedicating to him his &lsquo;Life of Jack Wilton&rsquo; in 1594, as
&lsquo;a dear lover and cherisher as well of the lovers of poets as of the
poets themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nash addressed to him many affectionately
phrased sonnets.&nbsp; The prolific sonnetteer Barnabe Barnes and the
miscellaneous literary practitioner Gervase Markham confessed, respectively
in 1593 and 1595, yearnings for Southampton&rsquo;s countenance in sonnets
which glow hardly less ardently than Shakespeare&rsquo;s with admiration
for his personal charm.&nbsp; Similarly John Florio, the Earl&rsquo;s
Italian tutor, who is traditionally reckoned among Shakespeare&rsquo;s
literary acquaintances, <a name="citation131b"></a><a href="#footnote131b"
class="citation">[131b]</a> wrote to Southampton in 1598, in his dedicatory
epistle before his &lsquo;Worlde of Wordes&rsquo; (an Italian-English
dictionary), &lsquo;as to me and many more, the glorious and gracious
sunshine of your honour hath infused light and life.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s fear of a rival poet.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare magnanimously and modestly described that
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Southampton, whom he deemed a specially
dangerous rival, as an &lsquo;able&rsquo; and a &lsquo;better&rsquo;
&lsquo;spirit,&rsquo; &lsquo;a worthier pen,&rsquo; a vessel of &lsquo;tall
building and of goodly pride,&rsquo; compared with whom he was himself
&lsquo;a worthless boat.&rsquo;&nbsp; He detected a touch of magic in the
man&rsquo;s writing.&nbsp; His &lsquo;spirit,&rsquo; Shakespeare
hyperbolically declared, had been &lsquo;by spirits taught to write <!--
page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>above a
mortal pitch,&rsquo; and &lsquo;an affable familiar ghost&rsquo; nightly
gulled him with intelligence.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s dismay at the
fascination exerted on his patron by &lsquo;the proud full sail of his
[rival&rsquo;s] great verse&rsquo; sealed for a time, he declared, the
springs of his own invention (lxxxvi.)</p>
<h3>Barnabe Barnes probably the rival.</h3>
<p>There is no need to insist too curiously on the justice of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s laudation of the other poet&rsquo;s&rsquo;
powers.&nbsp; He was presumably a new-comer in the literary field who
surprised older men of benevolent tendency into admiration by his promise
rather than by his achievement.&nbsp; &lsquo;Eloquence and courtesy,&rsquo;
wrote Gabriel Harvey at the time, &lsquo;are ever bountiful in the
amplifying vein;&rsquo; and writers of amiability, Harvey adds, habitually
blazoned the perfections that they hoped to see their young friends
achieve, in language implying that they had already achieved them.&nbsp;
All the conditions of the problem are satisfied by the rival&rsquo;s
identification with the young poet and scholar Barnabe Barnes, a poetic
panegyrist of Southampton and a prolific sonnetteer, who was deemed by
contemporary critics certain to prove a great poet.&nbsp; His first
collection of sonnets, &lsquo;Parthenophil and Parthenophe,&rsquo; with
many odes and madrigals interspersed, was printed in 1593; and his second,
&lsquo;A Centurie of Spiritual Sonnets,&rsquo; in 1595.&nbsp; Loud applause
greeted the first book, which included numerous adaptations from the
classical, Italian, and French poets, and disclosed, among many crudities,
some fascinating lyrics and at least one almost perfect sonnet (No. lxvi.
&lsquo;Ah, sweet content, where is thy mild abode?&rsquo;)&nbsp; <!-- page
133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Thomas
Churchyard called Barnes &lsquo;Petrarch&rsquo;s scholar;&rsquo; the
learned Gabriel Harvey bade him &lsquo;go forward in maturity as he had
begun in pregnancy,&rsquo; and &lsquo;be the gallant poet, like
Spenser;&rsquo; Campion judged his verse to be &lsquo;heady and
strong.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a sonnet that Barnes addressed in this earliest
volume to the &lsquo;virtuous&rsquo; Earl of Southampton he declared that
his patron&rsquo;s eyes were &lsquo;the heavenly lamps that give the Muses
light,&rsquo; and that his sole ambition was &lsquo;by flight to
rise&rsquo; to a height worthy of his patron&rsquo;s
&lsquo;virtues.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare sorrowfully pointed out in Sonnet
lxxviii. that his lord&rsquo;s eyes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  that taught the dumb on high to sing,<br />
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,<br />
Have added feathers to the learned&rsquo;s wing,<br />
And given grace a double majesty;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>while in the following sonnet he asserted that the &lsquo;worthier
pen&rsquo; of his dreaded rival when lending his patron
&lsquo;virtue&rsquo; was guilty of plagiarism, for he &lsquo;stole that
word&rsquo; from his patron&rsquo;s &lsquo;behaviour.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
emphasis laid by Barnes on the inspiration that he sought from
Southampton&rsquo;s &lsquo;gracious eyes&rsquo; on the one hand, and his
reiterated references to his patron&rsquo;s &lsquo;virtue&rsquo; on the
other, suggest that Shakespeare in these sonnets directly alluded to Barnes
as his chief competitor in the hotly contested race for Southampton&rsquo;s
favour.&nbsp; In Sonnet lxxxv. Shakespeare declares that &lsquo;he cries
Amen to every hymn that able spirit [<i>i.e.</i> his rival]
affords.&rsquo;&nbsp; Very few poets of the day in England followed
Ronsard&rsquo;s practice of bestowing the title of hymn on miscellaneous
poems, but Barnes twice applies <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>the word to his poems of love. <a
name="citation134a"></a><a href="#footnote134a"
class="citation">[134a]</a>&nbsp; When, too, Shakespeare in Sonnet lxxx.
employs nautical metaphors to indicate the relations of himself and his
rival with his patron&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My saucy bark inferior far to his . . .<br />
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he seems to write with an eye on Barnes&rsquo;s identical choice of
metaphor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My fancy&rsquo;s ship tossed here and there by these [<i>sc.</i>
sorrow&rsquo;s floods]<br />
Still floats in danger ranging to and fro.<br />
How fears my thoughts&rsquo; swift pinnace thine hard rock! <a
name="citation134b"></a><a href="#footnote134b"
class="citation">[134b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Other theories as to the rival&rsquo;s identity.</h3>
<p>Gervase Markham is equally emphatic in his sonnet to Southampton on the
potent influence of his patron&rsquo;s &lsquo;eyes,&rsquo; which, he says,
crown &lsquo;the most victorious pen&rsquo;&mdash;a possible reference to
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Nash&rsquo;s poetic praises of the Earl are no less
enthusiastic, and are of a finer literary temper than
Markham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But Shakespeare&rsquo;s description of his
rival&rsquo;s literary work fits far less closely the verse of Markham and
Nash than the verse of their fellow aspirant Barnes.</p>
<p>Many critics argue that the numbing fear of his rival&rsquo;s genius and
of its influence on his patron to which Shakespeare confessed in the
sonnets was more likely to be evoked by the work of George Chapman than by
that of any other contemporary poet.&nbsp; But Chapman had produced no
conspicuously &lsquo;great verse&rsquo; till he began his translation of
Homer in 1598; and although he appended in 1610 to a complete <!-- page
135--><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>edition of
his translation a sonnet to Southampton, it was couched in the coldest
terms of formality, and it was one of a series of sixteen sonnets each
addressed to a distinguished nobleman with whom the writer implies that he
had no previous relations. <a name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a>&nbsp; Drayton, <!-- page 136--><a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Ben Jonson, and
Marston have also been identified by various critics with &lsquo;the rival
poet,&rsquo; but none of these shared Southampton&rsquo;s bounty, nor are
the terms which Shakespeare applies to his rival&rsquo;s verse specially
applicable to the productions of any of them.</p>
<h3>Sonnets of friendship.</h3>
<p>Many besides the &lsquo;dedicatory&rsquo; sonnets are addressed to a
handsome youth of wealth and rank, for whom the poet avows
&lsquo;love,&rsquo; in the Elizabethan sense of friendship. <a
name="citation136"></a><a href="#footnote136"
class="citation">[136]</a>&nbsp; Although no specific reference is made
outside the twenty &lsquo;dedicatory&rsquo; sonnets to the youth as a
literary patron, and the clues to his identity are elsewhere vaguer, there
is good ground for the conclusion that the sonnets of disinterested love or
friendship also have Southampton for their subject.&nbsp; The sincerity of
the poet&rsquo;s sentiment is often open to doubt in these poems, but they
seem to illustrate a real intimacy subsisting between Shakespeare and a
young M&aelig;cenas.</p>
<h3><!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>Extravagances of literary compliment.</h3>
<p>Extravagant compliment&mdash;&lsquo;gross painting&rsquo; Shakespeare
calls it&mdash;was more conspicuous in the intercourse of patron and client
during the last years of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign than in any other
epoch.&nbsp; For this result the sovereign herself was in part
responsible.&nbsp; Contemporary schemes of literary compliment seemed
infected by the feigned accents of amorous passion and false rhapsodies on
her physical beauty with which men of letters servilely sought to satisfy
the old Queen&rsquo;s incurable greed of flattery. <a
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; Sir <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Philip Sidney
described with admirable point the adulatory excesses to which less exalted
patrons were habituated by literary dependents.&nbsp; He gave the warning
that as soon as a man showed interest in poetry or its producers, poets
straightway pronounced him &lsquo;to be most fair, most rich, most wise,
most all.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You shall dwell upon superlatives . . .&nbsp;
Your soule shall be placed with Dante&rsquo;s Beatrice.&rsquo; <a
name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a>&nbsp; The warmth of colouring which
distinguishes many of the sonnets that Shakespeare, under the guise of
disinterested friendship, addressed to the youth can be matched at nearly
all points in the adulation that patrons were in the habit of receiving
from literary dependents in the style that Sidney described. <a
name="citation138b"></a><a href="#footnote138b"
class="citation">[138b]</a></p>
<h3><!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>Patrons habitually addressed in affectionate terms.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare assured his friend that he could never grow old (civ.), that
the finest types of beauty and chivalry in medi&aelig;val romance lived
again in him (cvi.), that absence from him was misery, and that his
affection for him was unalterable.&nbsp; Hundreds of poets openly <!-- page
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>gave the
like assurances to their patrons.&nbsp; Southampton was only one of a crowd
of M&aelig;cenases whose panegyrists, writing without concealment in their
own names, credited them with every perfection of mind and body, and
&lsquo;placed them,&rsquo; in Sidney&rsquo;s apt phrase, &lsquo;with
Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Beatrice.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Illustrations of the practice abound.&nbsp; Matthew Roydon wrote of his
patron, Sir Philip Sidney:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His personage seemed most divine,<br />
A thousand graces one might count<br />
Upon his lovely cheerful eyne.<br />
To heare him speak and sweetly smile<br />
You were in Paradise the while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Edmund Spenser in a fine sonnet told his patron, Admiral Lord Charles
Howard, that &lsquo;his good personage and noble deeds&rsquo; made him the
pattern to the present age of the old heroes of whom &lsquo;the antique
poets&rsquo; were &lsquo;wont so much to sing.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
compliment, which Shakespeare turns to splendid account in Sonnet cvi.,
recurs constantly in contemporary sonnets of adulation. <a
name="citation140a"></a><a href="#footnote140a"
class="citation">[140a]</a>&nbsp; Ben Jonson apostrophised the Earl of
Desmond as &lsquo;my best-best lov&rsquo;d.&rsquo;&nbsp; Campion told Lord
Walden, the Earl of Suffolk&rsquo;s undistinguished heir, that although his
muse sought to express his love, &lsquo;the admired virtues&rsquo; of the
patron&rsquo;s youth</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bred such despairing to his daunted Muse<br />
That it could scarcely utter naked truth. <a name="citation140b"></a><a
href="#footnote140b" class="citation">[140b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>Dr. John Donne includes among his &lsquo;Verse Letters&rsquo; to
patrons and patronesses several sonnets of similar temper, one of which,
acknowledging a letter of news from a patron abroad, concludes thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And now thy alms is given, thy letter&rsquo;s read,<br />
The body risen again, the which was dead,<br />
And thy poor starveling bountifully fed.<br />
After this banquet my soul doth say grace,<br />
And praise thee for it and zealously embrace<br />
Thy love, though I think thy love in this case<br />
To be as gluttons&rsquo;, which say &lsquo;midst their meat<br />
They love that best of which they most do eat. <a name="citation141"></a><a
href="#footnote141" class="citation">[141]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tone of yearning for a man&rsquo;s affection is sounded by Donne and
Campion almost as plaintively in their sonnets to patrons as it was sounded
by Shakespeare.&nbsp; There is nothing, therefore, in the vocabulary of
affection which Shakespeare employed in his sonnets of friendship to
conflict with the theory that they were inscribed to a literary patron with
whom his intimacy was of the kind normally subsisting at the time between
literary clients and their patrons.</p>
<h3>Direct references to Southampton in the sonnets of friendship.</h3>
<p>We know Shakespeare had only one literary patron, the Earl of
Southampton, and the view that that nobleman is the hero of the sonnets of
&lsquo;friendship&rsquo; is strongly corroborated by such definite details
as can be deduced from the vague eulogies in those poems of the
youth&rsquo;s gifts and graces.&nbsp; Every compliment, in fact, paid by
Shakespeare to the youth, whether it be <!-- page 142--><a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>vaguely or definitely
phrased, applies to Southampton without the least straining of the
words.&nbsp; In real life beauty, birth, wealth, and wit sat
&lsquo;crowned&rsquo; in the Earl, whom poets acclaimed the handsomest of
Elizabethan courtiers, as plainly as in the hero of the poet&rsquo;s
verse.&nbsp; Southampton has left in his correspondence ample proofs of his
literary learning and taste, and, like the hero of the sonnets, was
&lsquo;as fair in knowledge as in hue.&rsquo;&nbsp; The opening sequence of
seventeen sonnets, in which a youth of rank and wealth is admonished to
marry and beget a son so that &lsquo;his fair house&rsquo; may not fall
into decay, can only have been addressed to a young peer like Southampton,
who was as yet unmarried, had vast possessions, and was the sole male
representative of his family.&nbsp; The sonnetteer&rsquo;s exclamation,
&lsquo;You had a father, let your son say so,&rsquo; had pertinence to
Southampton at any period between his father&rsquo;s death in his boyhood
and the close of his bachelorhood in 1598.&nbsp; To no other peer of the
day are the words exactly applicable.&nbsp; The &lsquo;lascivious
comment&rsquo; on his &lsquo;wanton sport&rsquo; which pursues the young
friend through the sonnets, and is so adroitly contrived as to add point to
the picture of his fascinating youth and beauty, obviously associates
itself with the reputation for sensual indulgence that Southampton acquired
both at Court and, according to Nash, among men of letters. <a
name="citation142"></a><a href="#footnote142"
class="citation">[142]</a></p>
<h3>His youthfulness.</h3>
<p>There is no force in the objection that the young man of the sonnets of
&lsquo;friendship&rsquo; must have <!-- page 143--><a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>been another than
Southampton because the terms in which he is often addressed imply extreme
youth.&nbsp; In 1594, a date to which I refer most of the sonnets
Southampton was barely twenty-one, and the young man had obviously reached
manhood.&nbsp; In Sonnet civ. Shakespeare notes that the first meeting
between him and his friend took place three years before that poem was
written, so that, if the words are to be taken literally, the poet may have
at times embodied reminiscences of Southampton when he was only seventeen
or eighteen. <a name="citation143a"></a><a href="#footnote143a"
class="citation">[143a]</a>&nbsp; But Shakespeare, already worn in worldly
experience, passed his thirtieth birthday in 1594, and he probably tended,
when on the threshold of middle life, to exaggerate the youthfulness of the
nobleman almost ten years his junior, who even later impressed his
acquaintances by his boyish appearance and disposition. <a
name="citation143b"></a><a href="#footnote143b"
class="citation">[143b]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;Young&rsquo; was the epithet
invariably applied to Southampton by all who knew anything of him even when
he was twenty-eight.&nbsp; In 1601 Sir Robert Cecil referred to him as the
&lsquo;poor young Earl.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>The evidence of portraits.</h3>
<p>But the most striking evidence of the identity of the <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>youth of the sonnets
of &lsquo;friendship&rsquo; with Southampton is found in the likeness of
feature and complexion which characterises the poet&rsquo;s description of
the youth&rsquo;s outward appearance and the extant pictures of Southampton
as a young man.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s many references to his
youth&rsquo;s &lsquo;painted counterfeit&rsquo; (xvi., xxiv., xlvii.,
lxvii.) suggest that his hero often sat for his portrait.&nbsp;
Southampton&rsquo;s countenance survives in probably more canvases than
that of any of his contemporaries.&nbsp; At least fourteen extant portraits
have been identified on good authority&mdash;nine paintings, three
miniatures (two by Peter Oliver and one by Isaac Oliver), and two
contemporary prints. <a name="citation144"></a><a href="#footnote144"
class="citation">[144]</a>&nbsp; Most of these, it is true, <!-- page
145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>portray
their subject in middle age, when the roses of youth had faded, and they
contribute nothing to the present argument.&nbsp; But the two portraits
that are now at Welbeck, the property of the Duke of Portland, give all the
information that can be desired of Southampton&rsquo;s aspect &lsquo;in his
youthful morn.&rsquo; <a name="citation145"></a><a href="#footnote145"
class="citation">[145]</a>&nbsp; One of these pictures represents the Earl
at twenty-one, and the other at twenty-five or twenty-six.&nbsp; The
earlier portrait, which is reproduced on the opposite page, shows a young
man resplendently attired.&nbsp; His doublet is of white satin; a broad
collar, edged with lace, half covers a pointed gorget of red leather,
embroidered with silver thread; the white trunks and knee-breeches are
laced with gold; the sword-belt, embroidered in red and gold, is decorated
at intervals with white silk bows; the hilt of the rapier is overlaid with
gold; purple garters, embroidered in silver thread, fasten the white
stockings below the knee.&nbsp; Light body armour, richly damascened, lies
on the ground to the right of the figure; and a white-plumed helmet stands
to the left on a table covered with a cloth of purple velvet embroidered in
gold.&nbsp; Such gorgeous raiment suggests that its wearer bestowed much
attention on his personal equipment.&nbsp; But the head is more interesting
than the body.&nbsp; The eyes are blue, the cheeks pink, the complexion
clear, and the expression sedate; rings are in the ears; beard and
moustache are at an incipient stage, and are of the same, bright auburn hue
as the hair in a picture of Southampton&rsquo;s mother <!-- page 146--><a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>that is also at
Welbeck. <a name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"
class="citation">[146a]</a>&nbsp; But, however scanty is the down on the
youth&rsquo;s cheek, the hair on his head is luxuriant.&nbsp; It is worn
very long, and falls over and below the shoulder.&nbsp; The colour is now
of walnut, but was originally of lighter tint.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p145.jpg">
<img alt="Henry Wriothesley" src="images/p145.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The portrait depicting Southampton five or six years later shows him in
prison, to which he was committed after his secret marriage in 1598.&nbsp;
A cat and a book in a jewelled binding are on a desk at his right
hand.&nbsp; Here the hair falls over both his shoulders in even greater
profusion, and is distinctly blonde.&nbsp; The beard and thin upturned
moustache are of brighter auburn and fuller than before, although still
slight.&nbsp; The blue eyes and colouring of the cheeks show signs of
ill-health, but differ little from those features in the earlier
portrait.</p>
<p>From either of the two Welbeck portraits of Southampton might
Shakespeare have drawn his picture of the youth in the Sonnets.&nbsp; Many
times does he tell us that the youth is fair in complexion, and that his
eyes are fair.&nbsp; In Sonnet lxviii., when he points to the youth&rsquo;s
face as a map of what beauty was &lsquo;without all ornament, itself and
true&rsquo;&mdash;before fashion sanctioned the use of artificial
&lsquo;golden tresses&rsquo;&mdash;there can be little doubt that he had in
mind the wealth of locks that fell about Southampton&rsquo;s neck. <a
name="citation146b"></a><a href="#footnote146b"
class="citation">[146b]</a></p>
<h3><!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Sonnet cvii. the last of the series.</h3>
<p>A few only of the sonnets that Shakespeare addressed to the youth can be
allotted to a date subsequent to 1594; only two bear on the surface signs
of a later composition.&nbsp; In Sonnet lxx. the poet no longer credits his
hero with juvenile wantonness, but with a &lsquo;pure, unstained
prime,&rsquo; which has &lsquo;passed by the ambush of young
days.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sonnet cvii., apparently the last of the series, was
penned almost a decade after the mass of its companions, for it makes
references that cannot be mistaken to three events that took place in
1603&mdash;to Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s death, to the accession of James I,
and to the release of the Earl of Southampton, who had been in prison since
he was convicted in 1601 of complicity in the rebellion of the Earl of
Essex.&nbsp; The first two events are thus described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured<br />
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;<br />
Incertainties now crown themselves assured<br />
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.</p>

<h3>Allusion to Elizabeth&rsquo;s death.</h3>
<p>It is in almost identical phrase that every pen in the spring of 1603
was felicitating the nation on the unexpected turn of events, by which
Elizabeth&rsquo;s crown had passed, without civil war, to the Scottish
King, and thus the revolution that had been foretold as the inevitable <!--
page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>consequence of Elizabeth&rsquo;s demise was happily
averted.&nbsp; Cynthia (<i>i.e.</i> the moon) was the Queen&rsquo;s
recognised poetic appellation.&nbsp; It is thus that she figures in the
verse of Barnfield, Spenser, Fulke Greville, and Ralegh, and her elegists
involuntarily followed the same fashion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Fair Cynthia&rsquo;s
dead&rsquo; sang one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luna&rsquo;s extinct; and now beholde the sunne<br />
Whose beames soake up the moysture of all teares,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>wrote Henry Petowe in his &lsquo;A Fewe Aprill Drops Showered on the
Hearse of Dead Eliza,&rsquo; 1603.&nbsp; There was hardly a verse-writer
who mourned her loss that did not typify it, moreover, as the eclipse of a
heavenly body.&nbsp; One poet asserted that death &lsquo;veiled her glory
in a cloud of night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Another argued: &lsquo;Naught can eclipse
her light, but that her star will shine in darkest night.&rsquo;&nbsp; A
third varied the formula thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  When winter had cast off her weed<br />
Our sun eclipsed did set.&nbsp; Oh! light most fair. <a

class="citation">[148a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time James was constantly said to have entered on his
inheritance &lsquo;not with an olive branch in his hand, but with a whole
forest of olives round about him, for he brought not peace to this kingdom
alone&rsquo; but to all Europe. <a name="citation148b"></a><a

<h3>Allusions to Southampton&rsquo;s release from prison.</h3>
<p>&lsquo;The drops of this most balmy time,&rsquo; in this same sonnet,
cvii., is an echo of another current strain of fancy.&nbsp; James came to
England in a springtide of rarely rivalled clemency, which was reckoned of
the <!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>happiest augury.&nbsp; &lsquo;All things look fresh,&rsquo; one
poet sang, &lsquo;to greet his excellence.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The air, the
seasons, and the earth&rsquo; were represented as in sympathy with the
general joy in &lsquo;this sweetest of all sweet springs.&rsquo;&nbsp; One
source of grief alone was acknowledged: Southampton was still a prisoner in
the Tower, &lsquo;supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.&rsquo;&nbsp; All
men, wrote Manningham, the diarist, on the day following the Queen&rsquo;s
death, wished him at liberty. <a name="citation149a"></a><a
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a>&nbsp; The wish was
fulfilled quickly.&nbsp; On April 10, 1603, his prison gates were opened by
&lsquo;a warrant from the king.&rsquo;&nbsp; So bountiful a beginning of
the new era, wrote John Chamberlain to Dudley Carleton two days later,
&lsquo;raised all men&rsquo;s spirits . . . and the very poets with their
idle pamphlets promised themselves&rsquo; great things. <a
name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b"
class="citation">[149b]</a>&nbsp; Samuel Daniel and John Davies celebrated
Southampton&rsquo;s release in buoyant verse. <a name="citation149c"></a><a
href="#footnote149c" class="citation">[149c]</a>&nbsp; It is improbable
that Shakespeare remained silent.&nbsp; &lsquo;My love looks fresh,&rsquo;
he wrote in the concluding lines of Sonnet cvii., and he repeated the
conventional promise that he had so often made before, that his friend
should live in his &lsquo;poor rhyme,&rsquo; &lsquo;when tyrants&rsquo;
crests and tombs of brass are spent.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is impossible to
resist the inference that Shakespeare thus saluted his patron on the close
of his days of tribulation.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius had then won
for him a public reputation that rendered him independent of any private
patron&rsquo;s <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>favour, and he made no further reference in
his writings to the patronage that Southampton had extended to him in
earlier years.&nbsp; But the terms in which he greeted his former protector
for the last time in verse justify the belief that, during his remaining
thirteen years of life, the poet cultivated friendly relations with the
Earl of Southampton, and was mindful to the last of the encouragement that
the young peer offered him while he was still on the threshold of the
temple of fame.</p>
<h2><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>X&mdash;THE SUPPOSED STORY OF INTRIGUE IN THE SONNETS</h2>
<p>It is hardly possible to doubt that had Shakespeare, who was more
prolific in invention than any other poet, poured out in his sonnets his
personal passions and emotions, he would have been carried by his
imagination, at every stage, far beyond the beaten tracks of the
conventional sonnetteers of his day.&nbsp; The imitative element in his
sonnets is large enough to refute the assertion that in them as a whole he
sought to &lsquo;unlock his heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is likely enough that
beneath all the conventional adulation bestowed by Shakespeare on
Southampton there lay a genuine affection, but his sonnets to the Earl were
no involuntary ebullitions of a devoted and disinterested friendship; they
were celebrations of a patron&rsquo;s favour in the terminology&mdash;often
raised by Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius to the loftiest heights of
poetry&mdash;that was invariably consecrated to such a purpose by a current
literary convention.&nbsp; Very few of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;sugared
sonnets&rsquo; have a substantial right to be regarded as untutored cries
of the soul.&nbsp; It is true that the sonnets in which the writer
reproaches himself with sin, or gives expression to a <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>sense of melancholy,
offer at times a convincing illusion of autobiographic confessions; and it
is just possible that they stand apart from the rest, and reveal the
writer&rsquo;s inner consciousness, in which case they are not to be
matched in any other of Shakespeare&rsquo;s literary compositions.&nbsp;
But they may be, on the other hand, merely literary meditations, conceived
by the greatest of dramatists, on infirmities incident to all human nature,
and only attempted after the cue had been given by rival sonnetteers.&nbsp;
At any rate, their energetic lines are often adapted from the less forcible
and less coherent utterances of contemporary poets, and the themes are
common to almost all Elizabethan collections of sonnets. <a
name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s noble sonnet on the
ravages of lust (cxxix.), for example, treats with marvellous force and
insight a stereotyped theme of sonnetteers, <!-- page 153--><a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>and it may have owed
its whole existence to Sir Philip Sidney&rsquo;s sonnet on
&lsquo;Desire.&rsquo; <a name="citation153a"></a><a href="#footnote153a"
class="citation">[153a]</a></p>
<h3>The youth&rsquo;s relations with the poet&rsquo;s mistress.</h3>
<p>Only in one group, composed of six sonnets scattered through the
collection, is there traceable a strand of wholly original sentiment, not
to be readily defined and boldly projecting from the web into which it is
wrought.&nbsp; This series of six sonnets deals with a love adventure of no
normal type.&nbsp; Sonnet cxliv. opens with the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two loves I have of comfort and despair<br />
Which like two angels do suggest (<i>i.e.</i> tempt) me still:<br />
The better angel is a man right fair,<br />
The worser spirit a woman colour&rsquo;d ill. <a name="citation153b"></a><a
href="#footnote153b" class="citation">[153b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The woman, the sonnetteer continues, has corrupted the man and has drawn
him from his &lsquo;side.&rsquo;&nbsp; Five other sonnets treat the same
theme.&nbsp; In three addressed to the man (xl., xli., and xlii.) the poet
mildly reproaches his youthful friend for having sought and won the favours
of a woman whom he himself loved &lsquo;dearly,&rsquo; but the trespass is
forgiven on account of the friend&rsquo;s youth and <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>beauty.&nbsp; In the
two remaining sonnets Shakespeare addresses the woman (cxxxiii. and
cxxxiv.), and he rebukes her for having enslaved not only himself but
&lsquo;his next self&rsquo;&mdash;his friend.&nbsp; Shakespeare, in his
denunciation elsewhere of a mistress&rsquo;s disdain of his advances,
assigns her blindness, like all the professional sonnetteers, to no better
defined cause than the perversity and depravity of womankind.&nbsp; In
these six sonnets alone does he categorically assign his mistress&rsquo;s
alienation to the fascinations of a dear friend or hint at such a cause for
his mistress&rsquo;s infidelity.&nbsp; The definite element of intrigue
that is developed here is not found anywhere else in the range of
Elizabethan sonnet-literature.&nbsp; The character of the innovation and
its treatment seem only capable of explanation by regarding the topic as a
reflection of Shakespeare&rsquo;s personal experience.&nbsp; But how far he
is sincere in his accounts of his sorrow in yielding his mistress to his
friend in order to retain the friendship of the latter must be decided by
each reader for himself.&nbsp; If all the words be taken literally, there
is disclosed an act of self-sacrifice that it is difficult to parallel or
explain.&nbsp; But it remains very doubtful if the affair does not rightly
belong to the annals of gallantry.&nbsp; The sonnetteer&rsquo;s complacent
condonation of the young man&rsquo;s offence chiefly suggests the deference
that was essential to the maintenance by a dependent of peaceful relations
with a self-willed and self-indulgent patron.&nbsp; Southampton&rsquo;s
sportive and lascivious temperament might easily impel him to divert to
himself the attention of an attractive woman by whom he saw that his poet
was fascinated, <!-- page 155--><a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>and he was unlikely to tolerate any outspoken
protest on the part of his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; There is no
clue to the lady&rsquo;s identity, and speculation on the topic is
useless.&nbsp; She may have given Shakespeare hints for his pictures of the
&lsquo;dark lady,&rsquo; but he treats that lady&rsquo;s obduracy
conventionally, and his vituperation of her sheds no light on the personal
history of the mistress who left him for his friend.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Willobie his Avisa.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The emotions roused in Shakespeare by the episode, even if potent at the
moment, were not likely to be deep-seated or enduring.&nbsp; And it is
possible that a half-jesting reference, which would deprive
Shakespeare&rsquo;s amorous adventure of serious import, was made to it by
a literary comrade in a poem that was licensed for publication on September
3, 1594, and was published immediately under the title of &lsquo;Willobie
his Avisa, or the True Picture of a Modest Maid and of a Chaste and
Constant Wife.&rsquo; <a name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a>&nbsp; In this volume, which mainly consists of
seventy-two cantos in varying numbers of six-line stanzas, the chaste
heroine, Avisa, holds converse&mdash;in the opening section as a maid, and
in the later section as a wife&mdash;with a series of passionate
adorers.&nbsp; In every case she firmly repulses their advances.&nbsp;
Midway through the book its alleged author&mdash;Henry Willobie&mdash;is
introduced in his own person as an ardent admirer, and the last twenty-nine
of the cantos rehearse his woes and Avisa&rsquo;s obduracy.&nbsp; To this
section there is <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>prefixed an argument in prose (canto
xliv.)&nbsp; It is there stated that Willobie, &lsquo;being suddenly
affected with the contagion of a fantastical wit at the first sight of
Avisa, pineth a while in secret grief.&nbsp; At length, not able any longer
to endure the burning heat of so fervent a humour, [he] bewrayeth the
secrecy of his disease unto his familiar friend <i>W. S.</i>, <i>who not
long before had tried the courtesy of the like passion and was now newly
recovered of the like infection</i>.&nbsp; Yet [W. S.], finding his friend
let blood in the same vein, took pleasure for a time to see him bleed, and
instead of stopping the issue, he enlargeth the wound with the sharp razor
of willing conceit,&rsquo; encouraging Willobie to believe that Avisa would
ultimately yield &lsquo;with pains, diligence, and some cost in
time.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The miserable comforter&rsquo; [W. S.], the
passage continues, was moved to comfort his friend &lsquo;with an
impossibility,&rsquo; for one of two reasons.&nbsp; Either &lsquo;he now
would secretly laugh at his friend&rsquo;s folly&rsquo; because he
&lsquo;had given occasion not long before unto others to laugh at his
own.&rsquo;&nbsp; Or &lsquo;he would see whether another could play his
part better than himself, and, in viewing after the course of this loving
comedy,&rsquo; would &lsquo;see whether it would sort to a happier end for
this new actor than it did for <i>the old player</i>.&nbsp; But at length
this comedy was like to have grown to a tragedy by the weak and feeble
estate that H. W. was brought unto,&rsquo; owing to Avisa&rsquo;s
unflinching rectitude.&nbsp; Happily, &lsquo;time and necessity&rsquo;
effected a cure.&nbsp; In two succeeding cantos in verse W. S. is
introduced in dialogue with Willobie, and he gives him, in <i>oratio
recta</i>, light-hearted and mocking counsel <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>which Willobie
accepts with results disastrous to his mental health.</p>
<p>Identity of initials, on which the theory of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
identity with H. W.&rsquo;s unfeeling adviser mainly rests, is not a strong
foundation, <a name="citation157"></a><a href="#footnote157"
class="citation">[157]</a> and doubt is justifiable as to whether the story
of &lsquo;Avisa&rsquo; and her lovers is not fictitious.&nbsp; In a preface
signed Hadrian Dorell, the writer, after mentioning that the alleged author
(Willobie) was dead, discusses somewhat enigmatically whether or no the
work is &lsquo;a poetical fiction.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a new edition of 1596
the same editor decides the question in the affirmative.&nbsp; But Dorell,
while making this admission, leaves untouched the curious episode of
&lsquo;W. S.&rsquo;&nbsp; The mention of &lsquo;W. S.&rsquo; as &lsquo;the
old player,&rsquo; and the employment of theatrical imagery in discussing
his relations with Willobie, must be coupled with the fact that
Shakespeare, at a date when mentions of him in print were rare, was
eulogised by name as the author of &lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; in some prefatory
verses to the volume.&nbsp; From such considerations the theory of
&lsquo;W. S.&rsquo;s&rsquo; identity with Willobie&rsquo;s acquaintance
acquires substance.&nbsp; If we assume that it was Shakespeare who took a
roguish delight in watching his friend Willobie suffer the disdain of
&lsquo;chaste Avisa&rsquo; because he had &lsquo;newly recovered&rsquo;
from the effects of <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>a like experience, it is clear that the theft
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s mistress by another friend did not cause him deep or
lasting distress.&nbsp; The allusions that were presumably made to the
episode by the author of &lsquo;Avisa&rsquo; bring it, in fact, nearer the
confines of comedy than of tragedy.</p>
<h3>Summary of conclusions respecting the sonnets.</h3>
<p>The processes of construction which are discernible in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets are thus seen to be identical with those that
are discernible in the rest of his literary work.&nbsp; They present one
more proof of his punctilious regard for the demands of public taste, and
of his marvellous genius and skill in adapting and transmuting for his own
purposes the labours of other workers in the field that for the moment
engaged his attention.&nbsp; Most of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets were
produced in 1594 under the incitement of that freakish rage for
sonnetteering which, taking its rise in Italy and sweeping over France on
its way to England, absorbed for some half-dozen years in this country a
greater volume of literary energy than has been applied to sonnetteering
within the same space of time here or elsewhere before or since.&nbsp; The
thousands of sonnets that were circulated in England between 1591 and 1597
were of every literary quality, from sublimity to inanity, and they
illustrated in form and topic every known phase of sonnetteering
activity.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s collection, which was put together at
haphazard and published surreptitiously many years after the poems were
written, was a medley, at times reaching heights of literary excellence
that none <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>other scaled, but as a whole reflecting the varied features of
the sonnetteering vogue.&nbsp; Apostrophes to metaphysical abstractions,
vivid picturings of the beauties of nature, adulation of a patron,
idealisation of a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s</i> regard for a
nobleman in the figurative language of amorous passion, amiable compliments
on a woman&rsquo;s hair or touch on the virginals, and vehement
denunciation of the falseness and frailty of womankind&mdash;all appear as
frequently in contemporary collections of sonnets as in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He borrows very many of his competitors&rsquo;
words and thoughts, but he so fused them with his fancy as often to
transfigure them.&nbsp; Genuine emotion or the writer&rsquo;s personal
experience very rarely inspired the Elizabethan sonnet, and
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets proved no exception to the rule.&nbsp; A
personal note may have escaped him involuntarily in the sonnets in which he
gives voice to a sense of melancholy and self-remorse, but his dramatic
instinct never slept, and there is no proof that he is doing more in those
sonnets than produce dramatically the illusion of a personal
confession.&nbsp; Only in one scattered series of six sonnets, where he
introduced a topic, unknown to other sonnetteers, of a lover&rsquo;s
supersession by his friend in a mistress&rsquo;s graces, does he seem to
show independence of his comrades and draw directly on an incident in his
own life, but even there the emotion is wanting in seriousness.&nbsp; The
sole biographical inference deducible from the sonnets is that at one time
in his career Shakespeare disdained no weapon of flattery in an endeavour
to monopolise the bountiful patronage of a young man of rank.&nbsp;
External evidence agrees with <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>internal evidence in identifying the belauded
patron with the Earl of Southampton, and the real value to a biographer of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets is the corroboration they offer of the ancient
tradition that the Earl of Southampton, to whom his two narrative poems
were openly dedicated, gave Shakespeare at an early period of his literary
career help and encouragement, which entitles the Earl to a place in the
poet&rsquo;s biography resembling that filled by the Duke Alfonso
d&rsquo;Este in the biography of Ariosto, or like that filled by Margaret,
duchess of Savoy, in the biography of Ronsard.</p>

161</span>XI&mdash;THE DEVELOPMENT OF DRAMATIC POWER</h2>
<h3>&lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>But, all the while that Shakespeare was fancifully assuring his
patron</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[How] to no other pass my verses tend<br />
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>his dramatic work was steadily advancing.&nbsp; To the winter season of
1595 probably belongs &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream.&rsquo; <a
name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161"
class="citation">[161]</a>&nbsp; The comedy may well have been written to
celebrate a marriage&mdash;perhaps the marriage of the universal patroness
of poets, Lucy Harington, to Edward Russell, third earl of Bedford, on
December 12, 1594; or that of William Stanley, earl of Derby, at Greenwich
on January 24, 1594-5.&nbsp; The elaborate compliment to the Queen,
&lsquo;a fair vestal throned by the west&rsquo; (II. i. 157 <i>seq.</i>),
was at once an acknowledgment of past marks of royal favour and an
invitation for their extension to the future.&nbsp; Oberon&rsquo;s fanciful
description (II. ii. 148-68) of the spot where he saw the little western
flower called &lsquo;Love-in-idleness&rsquo; that he bids Puck fetch for
him, has been interpreted as a reminiscence of one of the scenic pageants
with <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>which the Earl of Leicester entertained Queen Elizabeth on her
visit to Kenilworth in 1575. <a name="citation162"></a><a
href="#footnote162" class="citation">[162]</a>&nbsp; The whole play is in
the airiest and most graceful vein of comedy.&nbsp; Hints for the story can
be traced to a variety of sources&mdash;to Chaucer&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Knight&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; to Plutarch&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of
Theseus,&rsquo; to Ovid&rsquo;s &lsquo;Metamorphoses&rsquo; (bk. iv.), and
to the story of Oberon, the fairy-king, in the French medi&aelig;val
romance of &lsquo;Huon of Bordeaux,&rsquo; of which an English translation
by Lord Berners was first printed in 1534.&nbsp; The influence of John Lyly
is perceptible in the raillery in which both mortals and immortals
indulge.&nbsp; In the humorous presentation of the play of &lsquo;Pyramus
and Thisbe&rsquo; by the &lsquo;rude mechanicals&rsquo; of Athens,
Shakespeare improved upon a theme which he had already employed in
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the final scheme
of the &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo; is of the author&rsquo;s
freshest invention, and by endowing&mdash;practically for the first time in
literature&mdash;the phantoms of the fairy world with a genuine and a
sustained dramatic interest, Shakespeare may be said to have conquered a
new realm for art.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;All&rsquo;s Well.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>More sombre topics engaged him in the comedy of &lsquo;All&rsquo;s Well
that Ends Well,&rsquo; which may be tentatively assigned to 1595.&nbsp;
Meres, writing three years later, attributed to Shakespeare a piece called
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Won.&rsquo;&nbsp; This title, which is
not otherwise known, may well be applied <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>to &lsquo;All&rsquo;s
Well.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The Taming of The Shrew,&rsquo; which has also
been identified with &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Won,&rsquo; has far
slighter claim to the designation.&nbsp; The plot of &lsquo;All&rsquo;s
Well,&rsquo; like that of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; was drawn from
Painter&rsquo;s &lsquo;Palace of Pleasure&rsquo; (No. xxxviii.)&nbsp; The
original source is Boccaccio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Decamerone&rsquo; (giorn. iii.
nov. 9).&nbsp; Shakespeare, after his wont, grafted on the touching
story of Helena&rsquo;s love for the unworthy Bertram the comic characters
of the braggart Parolles, the pompous Lafeu, and a clown (Lavache) less
witty than his compeers.&nbsp; Another original creation, Bertram&rsquo;s
mother, Countess of Roussillon, is a charming portrait of old age.&nbsp; In
frequency of rhyme and other metrical characteristics the piece closely
resembles &lsquo;The Two Gentlemen,&rsquo; but the characterisation betrays
far greater power, and there are fewer conceits or crudities of
style.&nbsp; The pathetic element predominates.&nbsp; The heroine Helena,
whose &lsquo;pangs of despised love&rsquo; are expressed with touching
tenderness, ranks with the greatest of Shakespeare&rsquo;s female
creations.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Taming of the Shrew.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;The Taming of The Shrew&rsquo;&mdash;which, like
&lsquo;All&rsquo;s Well,&rsquo; was first printed in the folio&mdash;was
probably composed soon after the completion of that solemn comedy.&nbsp; It
is a revision of an old play on lines somewhat differing from those which
Shakespeare had followed previously.&nbsp; From &lsquo;The Taming of A
Shrew,&rsquo; a comedy first published in 1594, <a
name="citation163"></a><a href="#footnote163" class="citation">[163]</a>
Shakespeare drew the Induction and the scenes in which the hero Petruchio
<!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>conquers Catherine the Shrew.&nbsp; He first infused into them
the genuine spirit of comedy.&nbsp; But while following the old play in its
general outlines, Shakespeare&rsquo;s revised version added an entirely new
underplot&mdash;the story of Bianca and her lovers, which owes something to
the &lsquo;Supposes&rsquo; of George Gascoigne, an adaptation of
Ariosto&rsquo;s comedy called &lsquo;I Suppositi.&rsquo;&nbsp; Evidence of
style&mdash;the liberal introduction of tags of Latin and the exceptional
beat of the doggerel&mdash;makes it difficult to allot the Bianca scenes to
Shakespeare; those scenes were probably due to a coadjutor.</p>
<h3>Stratford allusions in the Induction.</h3>
<p>The Induction to &lsquo;The Taming of The Shrew&rsquo; has a direct
bearing on Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography, for the poet admits into it a
number of literal references to Stratford and his native county.&nbsp; Such
personalities are rare in Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, and can only be
paralleled in two of slightly later date&mdash;the &lsquo;Second Part of
Henry IV&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Merry Wives of Windsor.&rsquo;&nbsp; All
these local allusions may well be attributed to such a renewal of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s personal relations with the town, as is indicated by
external facts in his history of the same period.&nbsp; In the Induction
the tinker, Christopher Sly, describes himself as &lsquo;Old Sly&rsquo;s
son of Burton Heath.&rsquo;&nbsp; Burton Heath is Barton-on-the-Heath, the
home of Shakespeare&rsquo;s aunt, Edmund Lambert&rsquo;s wife, and of her
sons.&nbsp; The tinker in like vein confesses that he has run up a score
with Marian Hacket, the fat alewife of Wincot. <a name="citation164"></a><a
href="#footnote164" class="citation">[164]</a>&nbsp; The references <!--
page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>to
Wincot and the Hackets are singularly precise.&nbsp; The name of the maid
of the inn is given as Cicely Hacket, and the alehouse is described in the
stage direction as &lsquo;on a heath.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Wincot.</h3>
<p>Wincot was the familiar designation of three small Warwickshire
villages, and a good claim has been set up on behalf of each to be the
scene of Sly&rsquo;s drunken exploits.&nbsp; There is a very small hamlet
named Wincot within four miles of Stratford now consisting of a single
farmhouse which was once an Elizabethan mansion; it is situated on what was
doubtless in Shakespeare&rsquo;s day, before the land there was enclosed,
an open heath.&nbsp; This Wincot forms part of the parish of Quinton,
where, according to the parochial registers, a Hacket family resided in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s day.&nbsp; On November 21, 1591, &lsquo;Sara Hacket,
the daughter of Robert Hacket,&rsquo; was baptised in Quinton church. <a
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a>&nbsp; Yet by Warwickshire contemporaries the
Wincot of &lsquo;The Taming of The Shrew&rsquo; was unhesitatingly
identified with Wilnecote, near Tamworth, on the Staffordshire border of
Warwickshire, at some distance from Stratford.&nbsp; That <!-- page
166--><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>village,
whose name was pronounced &lsquo;Wincot,&rsquo; was celebrated for its ale
in the seventeenth century, a distinction which is not shown by
contemporary evidence to have belonged to any place of like name.&nbsp; The
Warwickshire poet, Sir Aston Cokain, within half a century of the
production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Taming of The Shrew,&rsquo;
addressed to &lsquo;Mr. Clement Fisher of Wincott&rsquo; (a well-known
resident at Wilnecote) verses which begin</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Shakspeare</i> your <i>Wincot</i> ale hath much renowned,<br />
That fox&rsquo;d a Beggar so (by chance was found<br />
Sleeping) that there needed not many a word<br />
To make him to believe he was a Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the succeeding lines the writer promises to visit
&lsquo;Wincot&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Wilnecote) to drink</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Such ale as <i>Shakspeare</i>
fancies<br />
Did put Kit Sly into such lordly trances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is therefore probable that Shakespeare consciously invested the home
of Kit Sly and of Kit&rsquo;s hostess with characteristics of Wilnecote as
well as of the hamlet near Stratford.</p>
<p>Wilmcote, the native place of Shakespeare&rsquo;s mother, is also said
to have been popularly pronounced &lsquo;Wincot.&rsquo;&nbsp; A tradition
which was first recorded by Capell as late as 1780 in his notes to the
&lsquo;Taming of The Shrew&rsquo; (p. 26) is to the effect that Shakespeare
often visited an inn at &lsquo;Wincot&rsquo; to enjoy the society of a
&lsquo;fool who belonged to a neighbouring mill,&rsquo; and the Wincot of
this story is, we are told, locally associated with the village of
Wilmcote.&nbsp; But the links <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>that connect Shakespeare&rsquo;s tinker with
Wilmcote are far slighter than those which connect him with Wincot and
Wilnecote.</p>
<p>The mention of Kit Sly&rsquo;s tavern comrades&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece,<br />
And Peter Turf and Henry Pimpernell&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was in all likelihood a reminiscence of contemporary Warwickshire life
as literal as the name of the hamlet where the drunkard dwelt.&nbsp; There
was a genuine Stephen Sly who was in the dramatist&rsquo;s day a
self-assertive citizen of Stratford; and &lsquo;Greece,&rsquo; whence
&lsquo;old John Naps&rsquo; derived his cognomen, is an obvious misreading
of Greet, a hamlet by Winchcombe in Gloucestershire, not far removed from
Shakespeare&rsquo;s native town.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Henry IV.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In 1597 Shakespeare turned once more to English history.&nbsp; From
Holinshed&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chronicle,&rsquo; and from a valueless but very
popular piece, &lsquo;The Famous Victories of Henry V,&rsquo; which was
repeatedly acted between 1588 and 1595, <a name="citation167"></a><a
href="#footnote167" class="citation">[167]</a> he worked up with splendid
energy two plays on the reign of Henry IV.&nbsp; They form one continuous
whole, but are known respectively as parts i. and ii. of &lsquo;Henry
IV.&rsquo;&nbsp; The &lsquo;Second Part of Henry IV&rsquo; is almost as
rich as the Induction to &lsquo;The Taming of The Shrew&rsquo; in direct
references to persons and districts familiar to Shakespeare.&nbsp; Two
amusing scenes pass at the house of Justice Shallow in Gloucestershire, a
county which touched the boundaries of <!-- page 168--><a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Stratford (III. ii.
and V. i.)&nbsp; When, in the second of these scenes, the justice&rsquo;s
factotum, Davy, asked his master &lsquo;to countenance William Visor of
Woncot <a name="citation168a"></a><a href="#footnote168a"
class="citation">[168a]</a> against Clement Perkes of the Hill,&rsquo; the
local references are unmistakable.&nbsp; Woodmancote, where the family of
Visor or Vizard has flourished since the sixteenth century, is still
pronounced Woncot.&nbsp; The adjoining Stinchcombe Hill (still familiarly
known to natives as &lsquo;The Hill&rsquo;) was in the sixteenth century
the home of the family of Perkes.&nbsp; Very precise too are the allusions
to the region of the Cotswold Hills, which were easily accessible from
Stratford.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will Squele, a Cotswold man,&rsquo; is noticed as
one of Shallow&rsquo;s friends in youth (III. ii. 23); and when
Shallow&rsquo;s servant Davy receives his master&rsquo;s instructions to
sow &lsquo;the headland&rsquo; &lsquo;with red wheat,&rsquo; in the early
autumn, there is an obvious reference to the custom almost peculiar to the
Cotswolds of sowing &lsquo;red lammas&rsquo; wheat at an unusually early
season of the agricultural year. <a name="citation168b"></a><a
href="#footnote168b" class="citation">[168b]</a></p>
<p>The kingly hero of the two plays of &lsquo;Henry IV&rsquo; had figured
as a spirited young man in &lsquo;Richard II;&rsquo; he was now represented
as weighed down by care and age.&nbsp; With him are contrasted (in part i.)
his impetuous and ambitious subject Hotspur and (in <!-- page 169--><a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>both parts) his son
and heir Prince Hal, whose boisterous disposition drives him from Court to
seek adventures among the haunters of taverns.&nbsp; Hotspur is a vivid and
fascinating portrait of a hot-headed soldier, courageous to the point of
rashness, and sacrificing his life to his impetuous sense of honour.&nbsp;
Prince Hal, despite his vagaries, is endowed by the dramatist with far more
self-control and common sense.</p>
<h3>Falstaff.</h3>
<p>On the first, as on every subsequent, production of &lsquo;Henry
IV&rsquo; the main public interest was concentrated neither on the King nor
on his son, nor on Hotspur, but on the chief of Prince Hal&rsquo;s riotous
companions.&nbsp; At the outset the propriety of that great creation was
questioned on a political or historical ground of doubtful relevance.&nbsp;
Shakespeare in both parts of &lsquo;Henry IV&rsquo; originally named the
chief of the prince&rsquo;s associates after Sir John Oldcastle, a
character in the old play.&nbsp; But Henry Brooke, eighth lord Cobham, who
succeeded to the title early in 1597, and claimed descent from the
historical Sir John Oldcastle, the Lollard leader, raised objection; and
when the first part of the play was printed by the acting-company&rsquo;s
authority in 1598 (&lsquo;newly corrected&rsquo; in 1599), Shakespeare
bestowed on Prince Hal&rsquo;s tun-bellied follower the new and deathless
name of Falstaff.&nbsp; A trustworthy edition of the second part of
&lsquo;Henry IV&rsquo; also appeared with Falstaff&rsquo;s name substituted
for that of Oldcastle in 1600.&nbsp; There the epilogue expressly denied
that Falstaff had any characteristic in common with the martyr
Oldcastle.&nbsp; <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the
man.&nbsp; But the substitution of the name &lsquo;Falstaff&rsquo; did not
pass without protest.&nbsp; It hazily recalled Sir John Fastolf, an
historical warrior who had already figured in &lsquo;Henry VI&rsquo; and
was owner at one time of the Boar&rsquo;s Head Tavern in Southwark;
according to traditional stage directions, <a name="citation170"></a><a
href="#footnote170" class="citation">[170]</a> the prince and his
companions in &lsquo;Henry IV&rsquo; frequent the Boar&rsquo;s Head,
Eastcheap.&nbsp; Fuller in his &lsquo;Worthies,&rsquo; first published in
1662, while expressing satisfaction that Shakespeare had &lsquo;put
out&rsquo; of the play Sir John Oldcastle, was eloquent in his avowal of
regret that &lsquo;Sir John Fastolf&rsquo; was &lsquo;put in,&rsquo; on the
ground that it was making overbold with a great warrior&rsquo;s memory to
make him a &lsquo;Thrasonical puff and emblem of mock-valour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The offending introduction and withdrawal of Oldcastle&rsquo;s name left
a curious mark on literary history.&nbsp; Humbler dramatists (Munday,
Wilson, Drayton, and Hathaway), seeking to profit by the attention drawn by
Shakespeare to the historical Oldcastle, produced a poor dramatic version
of Oldcastle&rsquo;s genuine history; and of two editions of &lsquo;Sir
John Oldcastle&rsquo; published in 1600, one printed for T[homas] P[avier]
was impudently described on the title-page as by Shakespeare.</p>
<p>But it is not the historical traditions which are connected with
Falstaff that give him his perennial attraction.&nbsp; It is the
personality that owes nothing to history with which Shakespeare&rsquo;s
imaginative <!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>power clothed him.&nbsp; The knight&rsquo;s unfettered indulgence
in sensual pleasures, his exuberant mendacity, and his love of his own ease
are purged of offence by his colossal wit and jollity, while the contrast
between his old age and his unreverend way of life supplies that tinge of
melancholy which is inseparable from the highest manifestations of
humour.&nbsp; The Elizabethan public recognised the triumphant success of
the effort, and many of Falstaff&rsquo;s telling phrases, with the names of
his foils, Justice Shallow and Silence, at once took root in popular
speech.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s purely comic power culminated in
Falstaff; he may be claimed as the most humorous figure in literature.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Merry Wives of Windsor.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In all probability &lsquo;The Merry Wives of Windsor,&rsquo; a comedy
inclining to farce, and unqualified by any pathetic interest, followed
close upon &lsquo;Henry IV.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the epilogue to the
&lsquo;Second Part of Henry IV&rsquo; Shakespeare had written: &lsquo;If
you be not too much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue
the story with Sir John in it . . . where for anything I know Falstaff
shall die of a sweat, unless already a&rsquo; be killed with your hard
opinions.&rsquo;&nbsp; Rowe asserts that &lsquo;Queen Elizabeth was so well
pleased with that admirable character of Falstaff in the two parts of
&ldquo;Henry IV&rdquo; that she commanded him to continue it for one play
more, and to show him in love.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dennis, in the dedication of
&lsquo;The Comical Gallant&rsquo; (1702), noted that the &lsquo;Merry
Wives&rsquo; was written at the Queen&rsquo;s &lsquo;command and by her
direction; and she was so eager to see it acted that she commanded it to be
finished in fourteen days, and <!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>was afterwards, as tradition tells us, very
well pleased with the representation.&rsquo;&nbsp; In his
&lsquo;Letters&rsquo; (1721, p. 232) Dennis reduces the period of
composition to ten days&mdash;&lsquo;a prodigious thing,&rsquo; added
Gildon, <a name="citation172a"></a><a href="#footnote172a"
class="citation">[172a]</a> &lsquo;where all is so well contrived and
carried on without the least confusion.&rsquo;&nbsp; The localisation of
the scene at Windsor, and the complimentary references to Windsor Castle,
corroborate the tradition that the comedy was prepared to meet a royal
command.&nbsp; An imperfect draft of the play was printed by Thomas Creede
in 1602; <a name="citation172b"></a><a href="#footnote172b"
class="citation">[172b]</a> the folio of 1623 first supplied a complete
version.&nbsp; The plot was probably suggested by an Italian novel.&nbsp; A
tale from Straparola&rsquo;s &lsquo;Notti&rsquo; (iv. 4), of which an
adaptation figured in the miscellany of novels called Tarleton&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Newes out of Purgatorie&rsquo; (1590), another Italian tale from the
&lsquo;Pecorone&rsquo; of Ser Giovanni Fiorentino (i. 2), and a third
romance, the Fishwife&rsquo;s tale of Brainford in the collection of
stories called &lsquo;Westward for Smelts,&rsquo; <a
name="citation172c"></a><a href="#footnote172c" class="citation">[172c]</a>
supply incidents distantly resembling episodes in the play.&nbsp; Nowhere
has Shakespeare so vividly reflected the bluff temper of contemporary
middle-class society.&nbsp; The presentment of the buoyant domestic life of
an Elizabethan country town bears distinct impress of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
own experience.&nbsp; Again, there are literal references to the <!-- page
173--><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>neighbourhood of Stratford.&nbsp; Justice Shallow, whose
coat-of-arms is described as consisting of &lsquo;luces,&rsquo; is thereby
openly identified with Shakespeare&rsquo;s early foe, Sir Thomas Lucy of
Charlecote.&nbsp; When Shakespeare makes Master Slender repeat the report
that Master Page&rsquo;s fallow greyhound was &lsquo;outrun on
Cotsall&rsquo; (I. i. 93), he testifies to his interest in the coursing
matches for which the Cotswold district was famed.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Henry V.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The spirited character of Prince Hal was peculiarly congenial to its
creator, and in &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; Shakespeare, during 1598, brought his
career to its close.&nbsp; The play was performed early in 1599, probably
in the newly built Globe Theatre.&nbsp; Again Thomas Creede printed, in
1600, an imperfect draft, which was thrice reissued before a complete
version was supplied in the First Folio of 1623.&nbsp; The dramatic
interest of &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; is slender.&nbsp; There is abundance of
comic element, but death has removed Falstaff, whose last moments are
described with the simple pathos that comes of a matchless art, and, though
Falstaff&rsquo;s companions survive, they are thin shadows of his
substantial figure.&nbsp; New comic characters are introduced in the
persons of three soldiers respectively of Welsh, Scottish, and Irish
nationality, whose racial traits are contrasted with telling effect.&nbsp;
The irascible Irishman, Captain MacMorris, is the only representative of
his nation who figures in the long list of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; The scene in which the pedantic but patriotic
Welshman, Fluellen, avenges the sneers of the braggart Pistol at his
nation&rsquo;s emblem, by <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>forcing him to eat the leek, overflows in
vivacious humour.&nbsp; The piece in its main current presents a series of
loosely connected episodes in which the hero&rsquo;s manliness is displayed
as soldier, ruler, and lover.&nbsp; The topic reached its climax in the
victory of the English at Agincourt, which powerfully appealed to patriotic
sentiment.&nbsp; Besides the &lsquo;Famous Victories,&rsquo; <a
name="citation174"></a><a href="#footnote174" class="citation">[174]</a>
there was another lost piece on the subject, which Henslowe produced for
the first time on November 28, 1595.&nbsp; &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; may be
regarded as Shakespeare&rsquo;s final experiment in the dramatisation of
English history, and it artistically rounds off the series of his
&lsquo;histories&rsquo; which form collectively a kind of national
epic.&nbsp; For &lsquo;Henry VIII,&rsquo; which was produced very late in
his career, he was only in part responsible, and that &lsquo;history&rsquo;
consequently belongs to a different category.</p>
<h3>Essex and the rebellion of 1601.</h3>
<p>A glimpse of autobiography may be discerned in the direct mention by
Shakespeare in &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; of an exciting episode in current
history.&nbsp; In the prologue to act v. Shakespeare foretold for Robert
Devereux, second earl of Essex, the close friend of his patron Southampton,
an enthusiastic reception by the people of London when he should come home
after &lsquo;broaching&rsquo; rebellion in Ireland.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were now the general of our gracious empress,<br />
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,<br />
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,<br />
How many would the peaceful city quit<br />
To welcome him!&mdash;(Act v. Chorus, ll. 30-4.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essex had set out on his disastrous mission as <!-- page 175--><a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>the would-be
pacificator of Ireland on March 27, 1599.&nbsp; The fact that Southampton
went with him probably accounts for Shakespeare&rsquo;s avowal of
sympathy.&nbsp; But Essex&rsquo;s effort failed.&nbsp; He was charged, soon
after &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; was produced, with treasonable neglect of duty,
and he sought in 1601, again with the support of Southampton, to recover
his position by stirring up rebellion in London.&nbsp; Then
Shakespeare&rsquo;s reference to Essex&rsquo;s popularity with Londoners
bore perilous fruit.&nbsp; The friends of the rebel leaders sought the
dramatist&rsquo;s countenance.&nbsp; They paid 40s. to Augustine Phillips,
a leading member of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company, to induce him to revive at
the Globe Theatre &lsquo;Richard II&rsquo; (beyond doubt
Shakespeare&rsquo;s play), in the hope that its scene of the killing of a
king might encourage a popular outbreak.&nbsp; Phillips subsequently
deposed that he prudently told the conspirators who bespoke the piece that
&lsquo;that play of Kyng Richard&rsquo; was &lsquo;so old and so long out
of use as that they should have small or no company at it.&rsquo;&nbsp;
None the less the performance took place on Saturday (February 7, 1601),
the day preceding that fixed by Essex for the rising.&nbsp; The Queen, in a
later conversation with William Lambarde (on August 4, 1601), complained
that &lsquo;this tragedie&rsquo; of &lsquo;Richard II,&rsquo; which she had
always viewed with suspicion, was played at the period with seditious
intent &lsquo;forty times in open streets and houses.&rsquo; <a
name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a>&nbsp; At the trial of Essex and his friends,
Phillips gave evidence of the circumstances under which the tragedy was
revived at the <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Globe Theatre.&nbsp; Essex was executed and
Southampton was imprisoned until the Queen&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; No
proceedings were taken against the players, <a name="citation176a"></a><a
href="#footnote176a" class="citation">[176a]</a> but Shakespeare wisely
abstained, for the time, from any public reference to the fate either of
Essex or of his patron Southampton.</p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s popularity and influence.</h3>
<p>Such incidents served to accentuate Shakespeare&rsquo;s growing
reputation.&nbsp; For several years his genius as dramatist and poet had
been acknowledged by critics and playgoers alike, and his social and
professional position had become considerable.&nbsp; Inside the theatre his
influence was supreme.&nbsp; When, in 1598, the manager of the company
rejected Ben Jonson&rsquo;s first comedy&mdash;his &lsquo;Every Man in his
Humour&rsquo;&mdash;Shakespeare intervened, according to a credible
tradition (reported by Rowe but denounced by Gifford), and procured a
reversal of the decision in the interest of the unknown dramatist who was
his junior by nine years.&nbsp; He took a part when the piece was
performed.&nbsp; Jonson was of a difficult and jealous temper, and
subsequently he gave vent to an occasional expression of scorn at
Shakespeare&rsquo;s expense, but, despite passing manifestations of his
unconquerable surliness, there can be no doubt that Jonson cherished
genuine esteem and affection for Shakespeare till death. <a
name="citation176b"></a><a href="#footnote176b"
class="citation">[176b]</a>&nbsp; Within a very few years of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s death Sir Nicholas L&rsquo;Estrange, an <!-- page
177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>industrious
collector of anecdotes, put into writing an anecdote for which he made Dr.
Donne responsible, attesting the amicable relations that habitually
subsisted between Shakespeare and Jonson.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shakespeare,&rsquo;
ran the story, &lsquo;was godfather to one of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s children,
and after the christening, being in a deep study, Jonson came to cheer him
up and asked him why he was so melancholy.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, faith,
Ben,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;not I, but I have been considering a great
while what should be the fittest gift for me to bestow upon my godchild,
and I have resolv&rsquo;d at last.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I pr&rsquo;ythee,
what?&rdquo; sayes he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo; faith, Ben, I&rsquo;ll
e&rsquo;en give him a dozen good Lattin spoons, and thou shalt translate
them.&rdquo;&rsquo; <a name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a></p>
<h3>The Mermaid meetings.</h3>
<p>The creator of Falstaff could have been no stranger to tavern life, and
he doubtless took part with zest in the convivialities of men of
letters.&nbsp; Tradition reports that Shakespeare joined, at the Mermaid
Tavern in Bread Street, those meetings of Jonson and his associates which
Beaumont described in his poetical &lsquo;Letter&rsquo; to Jonson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&lsquo;What things have we seen<br />
Done at the Mermaid? heard words that have been<br />
So nimble, and so full of subtle flame,<br />
As if that every one from whence they came<br />
Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,<br />
And had resolved to live a fool the rest<br />
Of his dull life.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>&lsquo;Many were the wit-combats,&rsquo; wrote Fuller of
Shakespeare in his &lsquo;Worthies&rsquo; (1662), &lsquo;betwixt him and
Ben Jonson, which two I behold like a Spanish great galleon and an English
man of war; Master Jonson (like the former) was built far higher in
learning, solid but slow in his performances.&nbsp; Shakespear, with the
Englishman of war, lesser in bulk, but lighter in sailing, could turn with
all tides, tack about, and take advantage of all winds by the quickness of
his wit and invention.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Mere&rsquo;s eulogy, 1598.</h3>
<p>Of the many testimonies paid to Shakespeare&rsquo;s literary reputation
at this period of his career, the most striking was that of Francis
Meres.&nbsp; Meres was a learned graduate of Cambridge University, a divine
and schoolmaster, who brought out in 1598 a collection of apophthegms on
morals, religion, and literature which he entitled &lsquo;Palladis
Tamia.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the book he interpolated &lsquo;A comparative
discourse of our English poets with the Greek, Latin, and Italian
poets,&rsquo; and there exhaustively surveyed contemporary literary effort
in England.&nbsp; Shakespeare figured in Meres&rsquo;s pages as the
greatest man of letters of the day.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Muses would speak
Shakespeare&rsquo;s fine filed phrase,&rsquo; Meres asserted, &lsquo;if
they could speak English.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Among the English,&rsquo; he
declared, &lsquo;he was the most excellent in both kinds for the
stage&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> tragedy and comedy).&nbsp; The titles of six
comedies (&lsquo;Two Gentlemen of Verona, &lsquo;Errors,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost,&rsquo; &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Won,&rsquo; &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Merchant of Venice&rsquo;) and of six tragedies (&lsquo;Richard
II,&rsquo; &lsquo;Richard III,&rsquo; &lsquo;Henry IV,&rsquo; &lsquo;King
<!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>John,&rsquo; &lsquo;Titus,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Romeo and
Juliet&rsquo;) were set forth, and mention followed of his &lsquo;Venus and
Adonis,&rsquo; his &lsquo;Lucrece,&rsquo; and his &lsquo;sugred <a
name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179" class="citation">[179]</a>
sonnets among his private friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; These were cited as proof
&lsquo;that the sweet witty soul of Ovid lives in mellifluous and
honey-tongued Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the same year a rival poet,
Richard Barnfield, in &lsquo;Poems in divers Humors,&rsquo; predicted
immortality for Shakespeare with no less confidence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And Shakespeare, thou whose honey-flowing vein<br />
(Pleasing the world) thy Praises doth obtain,<br />
Whose <i>Venus</i> and whose <i>Lucrece</i> (sweet and chaste)<br />
Thy name in Fame&rsquo;s immortal Book have placed,<br />
Live ever you, at least in fame live ever:<br />
Well may the Body die, but Fame dies never.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Value of his name to publishers.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s name was thenceforth of value to unprincipled
publishers, and they sought to palm off on their customers as his work the
productions of inferior pens.&nbsp; As early as 1595, Thomas Creede, the
surreptitious printer of &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Merry
Wives,&rsquo; had issued the crude &lsquo;Tragedie of Locrine, as
&lsquo;newly set foorth, overseene and corrected.&nbsp; By W.
S.&rsquo;&nbsp; It appropriated many passages from an older piece called
&lsquo;Selimus,&rsquo; which was possibly by Greene and certainly came <!--
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>into
being long before Shakespeare had written a line of blank verse.&nbsp; The
same initials&mdash;&lsquo;W.S.&rsquo; <a name="citation180"></a><a
href="#footnote180" class="citation">[180]</a>&mdash;figured on the
title-page of &lsquo;The True Chronicle Historie of Thomas, Lord
Cromwell,&rsquo; which was licensed on August 11, 1602, was printed for
William Jones in that year, and was reprinted verbatim by Thomas Snodham in
1613.&nbsp; On the title-page of the comedy entitled &lsquo;The Puritaine,
or the Widdow of Watling Streete,&rsquo; which George Eld printed in 1607,
&lsquo;W.S.&rsquo; was again stated to be the author.&nbsp;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s full name appeared on the title-pages of &lsquo;The
Life of Old-castle&rsquo; in 1600 (printed for T[homas] P[avier]), of
&lsquo;The London Prodigall&rsquo; in 1605 (printed by T. C. for Nathaniel
Butter), and of &lsquo;The Yorkshire Tragedy&rsquo; in 1608 (by R. B. for
Thomas Pavier).&nbsp; None of these six plays have any internal claim to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s authorship; nevertheless all were uncritically included
in the third folio of his collected works,(1664).&nbsp; Schlegel and a few
other critics of repute have, on no grounds that merit acceptance, detected
signs of Shakespeare&rsquo;s genuine work in one of the six, &lsquo;The
Yorkshire Tragedy;&rsquo; it is &lsquo;a coarse, crude, and vigorous <!--
page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>impromptu,&rsquo; which is clearly by a far less experienced
hand.</p>
<p>The fraudulent practice of crediting Shakespeare with valueless plays
from the pens of comparatively dull-witted contemporaries was in vogue
among enterprising traders in literature both early and late in the
seventeenth century.&nbsp; The worthless old play on the subject of King
John was attributed to Shakespeare in the reissues of 1611 and 1622.&nbsp;
Humphrey Moseley, a reckless publisher of a later period, fraudulently
entered on the &lsquo;Stationers&rsquo; Register&rsquo; on September 9,
1653, two pieces which he represented to be in whole or in part by
Shakespeare, viz. &lsquo;The Merry Devill of Edmonton&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;History of Cardenio,&rsquo; a share in which was assigned to
Fletcher.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Merry Devill of Edmonton,&rsquo; which was
produced on the stage before the close of the sixteenth century, was
entered on the &lsquo;Stationers&rsquo; Register,&rsquo; October 22, 1607,
and was first published anonymously in 1608; it is a delightful comedy,
abounding in both humour and romantic sentiment; at times it recalls scenes
of the &lsquo;Merry Wives of Windsor,&rsquo; but no sign of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s workmanship is apparent.&nbsp; The &lsquo;History of
Cardenio&rsquo; is not extant. <a name="citation181"></a><a
href="#footnote181" class="citation">[181]</a>&nbsp; Francis Kirkman,
another active London publisher, who first printed William Rowley&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Birth of Merlin&rsquo; in 1662, described it on the title-page as
&lsquo;written by William Shakespeare and William Rowley;&rsquo; it was
reprinted at Halle in a so-called &lsquo;Collection of pseudo-Shakespearean
plays&rsquo; in 1887.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;The Passionate Pilgrim.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>But poems no less than plays, in which Shakespeare had no hand, were
deceptively placed to his <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span

established.&nbsp; In 1599 William Jaggard, a well-known pirate publisher,
issued a poetic anthology which he entitled &lsquo;The Passionate Pilgrim,
by W. Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; The volume opened with two sonnets by
Shakespeare which were not previously in print, and there followed three
poems drawn from the already published &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost;&rsquo; but the bulk of the volume was by Richard Barnfield and
others. <a name="citation182"></a><a href="#footnote182"
class="citation">[182]</a>&nbsp; A third edition of the &lsquo;Passionate
Pilgrim&rsquo; was printed in 1612 with unaltered title-page, although the
incorrigible Jaggard had added two new poems which he silently filched from
Thomas Heywood&rsquo;s &lsquo;Troia Britannica.&rsquo;&nbsp; Heywood called
attention to his own grievance in the dedicatory epistle before his
&lsquo;Apology for Actors&rsquo; (1612), and he added that Shakespeare
resented the more substantial injury which the publisher had done
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know,&rsquo; wrote Heywood of Shakespeare, &lsquo;[he
was] much offended with M. Jaggard that (altogether unknown to him)
presumed to make so bold with his name.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the result <!--
page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>the
publisher seems to have removed Shakespeare&rsquo;s name from the
title-page of a few copies.&nbsp; This is the only instance on record of a
protest on Shakespeare&rsquo;s part against the many injuries which he
suffered at the hands of contemporary publishers.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;The Ph&oelig;nix and the Turtle.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In 1601 Shakespeare&rsquo;s full name was appended to &lsquo;a poetical
essaie on the Ph&oelig;nix and the Turtle,&rsquo; which was published by
Edward Blount in an appendix to Robert Chester&rsquo;s &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s
Martyr, or Rosalins complaint, allegorically shadowing the Truth of Love in
the Constant Fate of the Ph&oelig;nix and Turtle.&rsquo;&nbsp; The drift of
Chester&rsquo;s crabbed verse is not clear, nor can the praise of
perspicuity be allowed to the appendix to which Shakespeare contributed,
together with Marston, Chapman, Ben Jonson, and &lsquo;Ignoto.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The appendix is introduced by a new title-page running thus:
&lsquo;Hereafter follow diverse poeticall Essaies on the former subject,
viz: the Turtle and Ph&oelig;nix.&nbsp; Done by the best and chiefest of
our modern writers, with their names subscribed to their particular workes:
never before extant.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s alleged contribution
consists of thirteen four-lined stanzas in trochaics, each line being of
seven syllables, with the rhymes disposed as in Tennyson&rsquo;s &lsquo;In
Memoriam.&rsquo;&nbsp; The concluding &lsquo;threnos&rsquo; is in five
three-lined stanzas, also in trochaics, each stanza having a single
rhyme.&nbsp; The poet describes in enigmatic language the obsequies of the
Ph&oelig;nix and the Turtle-dove, who had been united in life by the ties
of a purely spiritual love.&nbsp; The poem may be a mere play of fancy
without recondite intention, or it <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>may be of allegorical
import; but whether it bear relation to pending ecclesiastical, political,
or metaphysical controversy, or whether it interpret popular grief for the
death of some leaders of contemporary society, is not easily determined. <a

185</span>XII&mdash;THE PRACTICAL AFFAIRS OF LIFE</h2>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s practical temperament.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare, in middle life, brought to practical affairs a singularly
sane and sober temperament.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Ratseis Ghost&rsquo; (1605), an
anecdotal biography of Gamaliel Ratsey, a notorious highwayman, who was
hanged at Bedford on March 26, 1605, the highwayman is represented as
compelling a troop of actors whom he met by chance on the road to perform
in his presence.&nbsp; At the close of the performance Ratsey, according to
the memoir, addressed himself to a leader of the company, and cynically
urged him to practise the utmost frugality in London.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
thou feelest thy purse well lined (the counsellor proceeded), buy thee some
place or lordship in the country that, growing weary of playing, thy money
may there bring thee to dignity and reputation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whether or no
Ratsey&rsquo;s biographer consciously identified the highwayman&rsquo;s
auditor with Shakespeare, it was the prosaic course of conduct marked out
by Ratsey that Shakespeare literally followed.&nbsp; As soon as his
position in his profession was assured, he devoted his energies to
re-establishing the fallen fortunes of his family in his native <!-- page
186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>place, and
to acquiring for himself and his successors the status of gentlefolk.</p>
<h3>His father&rsquo;s difficulties.</h3>
<p>His father&rsquo;s pecuniary embarrassments had steadily increased since
his son&rsquo;s departure.&nbsp; Creditors harassed him unceasingly.&nbsp;
In 1587 one Nicholas Lane pursued him for a debt for which he had become
liable as surety for his brother Henry, who was still farming their
father&rsquo;s lands at Snitterfield.&nbsp; Through 1588 and 1589 John
Shakespeare retaliated with pertinacity on a debtor named John
Tompson.&nbsp; But in 1591 a creditor, Adrian Quiney, obtained a writ of
distraint against him, and although in 1592 he attested inventories taken
on the death of two neighbours, Ralph Shaw and Henry Field, father of the
London printer, he was on December 25 of the same year
&lsquo;presented&rsquo; as a recusant for absenting himself from
church.&nbsp; The commissioners reported that his absence was probably due
to &lsquo;fear of process for debt.&rsquo;&nbsp; He figures for the last
time in the proceedings of the local court, in his customary
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of defendant, on March 9, 1595.&nbsp; He was then joined
with two fellow traders&mdash;Philip Green, a chandler, and Henry Rogers, a
butcher&mdash;as defendant in a suit brought by Adrian Quiney and Thomas
Barker for the recovery of the sum of five pounds.&nbsp; Unlike his
partners in the litigation, his name is not followed in the record by a
mention of his calling, and when the suit reached a later stage his name
was omitted altogether.&nbsp; These may be viewed as indications that in
the course of the proceedings he finally retired from trade, which had been
of late prolific in disasters for him.&nbsp; In January 1596-7 he <!-- page
187--><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>conveyed a
slip of land attached to his dwelling in Henley Street to one George
Badger.</p>
<h3>His wife&rsquo;s debt.</h3>
<p>There is a likelihood that the poet&rsquo;s wife fared, in the
poet&rsquo;s absence, no better than his father.&nbsp; The only
contemporary mention made of her between her marriage in 1582 and her
husband&rsquo;s death in 1616 is as the borrower at an unascertained date
(evidently before 1595) of forty shillings from Thomas Whittington, who had
formerly been her father&rsquo;s shepherd.&nbsp; The money was unpaid when
Whittington died in 1601, and he directed his executor to recover the sum
from the poet and distribute it among the poor of Stratford. <a
name="citation187"></a><a href="#footnote187"
class="citation">[187]</a></p>
<p>It was probably in 1596 that Shakespeare returned, after nearly eleven
years&rsquo; absence, to his native town, and worked a revolution in the
affairs of his family.&nbsp; The prosecutions of his father in the local
court ceased.&nbsp; Thenceforth the poet&rsquo;s relations with Stratford
were uninterrupted.&nbsp; He still resided in London for most of the year;
but until the close of his professional career he paid the town at least
one annual visit, and he was always formally described as &lsquo;of
Stratford-on-Avon, gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was no doubt there on August
11, 1596, when his only son, Hamnet, was buried in the parish church; the
boy was eleven and a half years old.</p>
<h3>The coat-of-arms.</h3>
<p>At the same date the poet&rsquo;s father, despite his pecuniary
embarrassments, took a step, by way of regaining his prestige, which must
be assigned to the <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>poet&rsquo;s intervention. <a
name="citation188a"></a><a href="#footnote188a"
class="citation">[188a]</a>&nbsp; He made application to the College of
Heralds for a coat-of-arms. <a name="citation188b"></a><a
href="#footnote188b" class="citation">[188b]</a>&nbsp; Then, as now, the
heralds when bestowing new coats-of-arms commonly credited the
applicant&rsquo;s family with an imaginary antiquity, and little reliance
need be placed on the biographical or genealogical statements alleged in
grants of arms.&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s father or the poet himself when
first applying to the College stated that John Shakespeare, in 1568, while
he was bailiff of Stratford, and while he was by virtue of that office a
justice of the peace, had obtained from Robert Cook, then Clarenceux
herald, a &lsquo;pattern&rsquo; or sketch of an armorial coat.&nbsp; This
allegation is not noticed in the records of the College, and may be a
formal fiction designed by John Shakespeare and his son to recommend their
claim to the notice of the heralds.&nbsp; The negotiations of 1568, if they
were not apocryphal, were certainly abortive; otherwise there would have
been no necessity for the further action of 1596.&nbsp; In any case, on
October 20, 1596, a draft, which remains in the College of Arms, was <!--
page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>prepared under the direction of William Dethick, Garter
King-of-Arms, granting John&rsquo;s request for a coat-of-arms.&nbsp;
Garter stated, with characteristic vagueness, that he had been &lsquo;by
credible report&rsquo; informed that the applicant&rsquo;s &lsquo;parentes
and late antecessors were for theire valeant and faithfull service advanced
and rewarded by the most prudent prince King Henry the Seventh of famous
memories sythence whiche tyme they have continewed at those partes
[<i>i.e.</i> Warwickshire] in good reputacion and credit;&rsquo; and that
&lsquo;the said John [had] maryed Mary, daughter and heiress of Robert
Arden, of Wilmcote, gent.&rsquo;&nbsp; In consideration of these titles to
honour, Garter declared that he assigned to Shakespeare this shield, viz.:
&lsquo;Gold, on a bend sable, a spear of the first, and for his crest or
cognizance a falcon, his wings displayed argent, standing on a wreath of
his colours, supporting a spear gold steeled as aforesaid.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
the margin of this draft-grant there is a pen sketch of the arms and crest,
and above them is written the motto, &lsquo;Non Sans Droict.&rsquo; <a
name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189"
class="citation">[189]</a>&nbsp; A second copy of the draft, also dated in
1596, is extant at the College.&nbsp; The only alterations are the
substitution of the word &lsquo;grandfather&rsquo; for
&lsquo;antecessors&rsquo; in the account of John Shakespeare&rsquo;s
ancestry, and the substitution of the word &lsquo;esquire&rsquo; for
&lsquo;gent&rsquo; in the description of his wife&rsquo;s father, Robert
Arden.&nbsp; At the foot of this draft, however, appeared some disconnected
and <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>unverifiable memoranda which John Shakespeare or his son had
supplied to the heralds, to the effect that John had been bailiff of
Stratford, had received a &lsquo;pattern&rsquo; of a shield from Clarenceux
Cook, was a man of substance, and had married into a worshipful family. <a
name="citation190"></a><a href="#footnote190"
class="citation">[190]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p190.jpg">
<img alt="Coat-of-arms" src="images/p190.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Neither of these drafts was fully executed.&nbsp; It may have been that
the unduly favourable representations made to the College respecting John
Shakespeare&rsquo;s social and pecuniary position excited suspicion even in
the habitually credulous minds of the heralds, or those officers may have
deemed the profession of the son, who was conducting the negotiation, a bar
to completing the transaction.&nbsp; At any rate, Shakespeare and his
father allowed three years to elapse before (as far as extant documents
show) they made a further endeavour to secure the coveted
distinction.&nbsp; In 1599 their efforts were crowned with success.&nbsp;
Changes in the interval among the officials at the College may have
facilitated the proceedings.&nbsp; In 1597 the Earl of Essex had become
Earl Marshal and chief of the Heralds&rsquo; College (the office had been
in commission in 1596); while the great scholar and <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>antiquary, William
Camden, had joined the College, also in 1597, as Clarenceux
King-of-Arms.&nbsp; The poet was favourably known to both Camden and the
Earl of Essex, the close friend of the Earl of Southampton.&nbsp; His
father&rsquo;s application now took a new form.&nbsp; No grant of arms was
asked for.&nbsp; It was asserted without qualification that the coat, as
set out in the draft-grants of 1596, had been <i>assigned</i> to John
Shakespeare while he was bailiff, and the heralds were merely invited to
give him a &lsquo;recognition&rsquo; or &lsquo;exemplification&rsquo; of
it. <a name="citation191"></a><a href="#footnote191"
class="citation">[191]</a>&nbsp; At the same time he asked permission for
himself to impale, and his eldest son and other children to quarter, on
&lsquo;his ancient coat-of-arms&rsquo; that of the Ardens of Wilmcote, his
wife&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; The College officers were characteristically
complacent.&nbsp; A draft was prepared under the hands of Dethick, the
Garter King, and of Camden, the Clarenceux King, granting the required
&lsquo;exemplification&rsquo; and authorising the required impalement and
quartering.&nbsp; On one point only did Dethick and Camden betray
conscientious scruples.&nbsp; Shakespeare and his father obviously desired
the heralds to recognise the title of Mary Shakespeare (the poet&rsquo;s
mother) to bear the arms of the great Warwickshire family of Arden, then
seated at Park Hall.&nbsp; But the relationship, if it existed, was
undetermined; the Warwickshire Ardens were gentry of influence in the
county, and were certain to <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>protest against any hasty assumption of
identity between their line and that of the humble farmer of
Wilmcote.&nbsp; After tricking the Warwickshire Arden coat in the margin of
the draft-grant for the purpose of indicating the manner of its impalement,
the heralds on second thoughts erased it.&nbsp; They substituted in their
sketch the arms of an Arden family living at Alvanley in the distant county
of Cheshire.&nbsp; With that stock there was no pretence that Robert Arden
of Wilmcote was lineally connected; but the bearers of the Alvanley coat
were unlikely to learn of its suggested impalement with the Shakespeare
shield, and the heralds were less liable to the risk of litigation.&nbsp;
But the Shakespeares wisely relieved the College of all anxiety by omitting
to assume the Arden coat.&nbsp; The Shakespeare arms alone are displayed
with full heraldic elaboration on the monument above the poet&rsquo;s grave
in Stratford Church; they alone appear on the seal and on the tombstone of
his elder daughter, Mrs. Susanna Hall, impaled with the arms of her
husband; <a name="citation192a"></a><a href="#footnote192a"
class="citation">[192a]</a> and they alone were quartered by Thomas Nash,
the first husband of the poet&rsquo;s granddaughter, Elizabeth Hall. <a
name="citation192b"></a><a href="#footnote192b"
class="citation">[192b]</a></p>
<p>Some objection was taken a few years later to the grant even of the
Shakespeare shield, but it was based on vexatious grounds that could not be
upheld.&nbsp; Early in the seventeenth century Ralph Brooke, who was York
herald from 1593 till his death in 1625, and was long engaged in a bitter
quarrel with his fellow <!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>officers at the College, complained that the
arms &lsquo;exemplified&rsquo; to Shakespeare usurped the coat of Lord
Mauley, on whose shield &lsquo;a bend sable&rsquo; also figured.&nbsp;
Dethick and Camden, who were responsible for any breach of heraldic
etiquette in the matter, answered that the Shakespeare shield bore no more
resemblance to the Mauley coat than it did to that of the Harley and the
Ferrers families, which also bore &lsquo;a bend sable,&rsquo; but that in
point of fact it differed conspicuously from all three by the presence of a
spear on the &lsquo;bend.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dethick and Camden added, with
customary want of precision, that the person to whom the grant was made had
&lsquo;borne magistracy and was justice of peace at Stratford-on-Avon; he
maried the daughter and heire of Arderne, and was able to maintain that
Estate.&rsquo; <a name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193"
class="citation">[193]</a></p>
<h3>Purchase of New Place.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1597, the poet had taken openly in his own person a more
effective step in the way of rehabilitating himself and his family in the
eyes of his fellow townsmen.&nbsp; On May 4 he purchased the largest house
in the town, known as New Place.&nbsp; It had been built by Sir Hugh
Clopton more than a century before, and seems to have fallen into a ruinous
condition.&nbsp; But Shakespeare paid for it, with two barns and two
gardens, the then substantial sum of &pound;60.&nbsp; Owing to the sudden
death of the vendor, <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>William Underhill, on July 7, 1597, the
original transfer of the property was left at the time incomplete.&nbsp;
Underhill&rsquo;s son Fulk died a felon, and he was succeeded in the family
estates by his brother Hercules, who on coming of age, May 1602, completed
in a new deed the transfer of New Place to Shakespeare. <a
name="citation194a"></a><a href="#footnote194a"
class="citation">[194a]</a>&nbsp; On February 4, 1597-8, Shakespeare was
described as a householder in Chapel Street ward, in which New Place was
situated, and as the owner of ten quarters of corn.&nbsp; The inventory was
made owing to the presence of famine in the town, and only two inhabitants
were credited with a larger holding.&nbsp; In the same year (1598) he
procured stone for the repair of the house, and before 1602 had planted a
fruit orchard.&nbsp; He is traditionally said to have interested himself in
the garden, and to have planted with his own hands a mulberry-tree, which
was long a prominent feature of it.&nbsp; When this was cut down, in 1758,
numerous relics were made from it, and were treated with an almost
superstitious veneration. <a name="citation194b"></a><a
href="#footnote194b" class="citation">[194b]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare does not
appear to have permanently settled at New Place till 1611.&nbsp; In 1609
<!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>the house, or part of it, was occupied by the town clerk, Thomas
Greene, &lsquo;alias Shakespeare,&rsquo; who claimed to be the poet&rsquo;s
cousin.&nbsp; His grandmother seems to have been a Shakespeare.&nbsp; He
often acted as the poet&rsquo;s legal adviser.</p>
<p>It was doubtless under their son&rsquo;s guidance that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s father and mother set on foot in November
1597&mdash;six months after his acquisition of New Place&mdash;a lawsuit
against John Lambert for the recovery of the mortgaged estate of Asbies in
Wilmcote.&nbsp; The litigation dragged on for some years without
result.</p>
<h3>Appeals for aid from his fellow-townsmen.</h3>
<p>Three letters written during 1598 by leading men at Stratford are still
extant among the Corporation&rsquo;s archives, and leave no doubt of the
reputation for wealth and influence with which the purchase of New Place
invested the poet in his fellow-townsmen&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Abraham
Sturley, who was once bailiff, writing early in 1598, apparently to a
brother in London, says: &lsquo;This is one special remembrance from our
father&rsquo;s motion.&nbsp; It seemeth by him that our countryman, Mr.
Shakspere, is willing to disburse some money upon some odd yardland or
other at Shottery, or near about us: he thinketh it a very fit pattern to
move him to deal in the matter of our tithes.&nbsp; By the instructions you
can give him thereof, and by the friends he can make therefor, we think it
a fair mark for him to shoot at, and would do us much good.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Richard Quiney, another townsman, father of Thomas (afterwards one of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s two sons-in-law), <!-- page 196--><a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>was, in the autumn of
the same year, harassed by debt, and on October 25 appealed to Shakespeare
for a loan of money.&nbsp; &lsquo;Loving countryman,&rsquo; the application
ran, &lsquo;I am bold of you as of a friend craving your help with
xxx<i>li</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Quiney was staying at the Bell Inn in Carter
Lane, London, and his main business in the metropolis was to procure
exemption for the town of Stratford from the payment of a subsidy.&nbsp;
Abraham Sturley, writing to Quiney from Stratford ten days later (on
November 4, 1598), pointed out to him that since the town was wholly
unable, in consequence of the dearth of corn, to pay the tax, he hoped
&lsquo;that our countryman, Mr. Wm. Shak., would procure us money, which I
will like of, as I shall hear when and where, and how.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Financial position before 1599.</h3>
<p>The financial prosperity to which this correspondence and the
transactions immediately preceding it point has been treated as one of the
chief mysteries of Shakespeare&rsquo;s career, but the difficulties are
gratuitous.&nbsp; There is practically nothing in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
financial position that a study of the contemporary conditions of
theatrical life does not fully explain.&nbsp; It was not until 1599, when
the Globe Theatre was built, that he acquired any share in the profits of a
playhouse.&nbsp; But his revenues as a successful dramatist and actor were
by no means contemptible at an earlier date.&nbsp; His gains in the
capacity of dramatist formed the smaller source of income.&nbsp; The
highest price known to have been paid before 1599 to an author for a play
by the manager of an acting company was <!-- page 197--><a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>&pound;11; &pound;6
was the lowest rate. <a name="citation197a"></a><a href="#footnote197a"
class="citation">[197a]</a>&nbsp; A small additional gratuity&mdash;rarely
apparently exceeding ten shillings&mdash;was bestowed on a dramatist whose
piece on its first production was especially well received; and the author
was by custom allotted, by way of &lsquo;benefit,&rsquo; a certain
proportion of the receipts of the theatre on the production of a play for
the second time. <a name="citation197b"></a><a href="#footnote197b"
class="citation">[197b]</a>&nbsp; Other sums, amounting at times to as much
as &pound;4, were bestowed on the author for revising and altering an old
play for a revival.&nbsp; The nineteen plays which may be set to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s credit between 1591 and 1599, combined with such
revising work as fell to his lot during those eight years, cannot
consequently have brought him less than &pound;200, or some &pound;20 a
year.&nbsp; Eight or nine of these plays were published during the period,
but the <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>publishers operated independently of the author, taking all the
risks and, at the same time, all the receipts.&nbsp; The publication of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays in no way affected his monetary resources,
although his friendly relations with the printer Field doubtless secured
him, despite the absence of any copyright law, some part of the profits in
the large and continuous sale of his poems.</p>
<p>But it was as an actor that at an early date he acquired a genuinely
substantial and secure income.&nbsp; There is abundance of contemporary
evidence to show that the stage was for an efficient actor an assured
avenue to comparative wealth.&nbsp; In 1590 Robert Greene describes in his
tract entitled &lsquo;Never too Late&rsquo; a meeting with a player whom he
took by his &lsquo;outward habit&rsquo; to be &lsquo;a gentleman of great
living&rsquo; and a &lsquo;substantial man.&rsquo;&nbsp; The player
informed Greene that he had at the beginning of his career travelled on
foot, bearing his theatrical properties on his back, but he prospered so
rapidly that at the time of speaking &lsquo;his very share in playing
apparel would not be sold for &pound;200.&rsquo;&nbsp; Among his neighbours
&lsquo;where he dwelt&rsquo; he was reputed able &lsquo;at his proper cost
to build a windmill.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the university play, &lsquo;The Return
from Parnassus&rsquo; (1601?), a poor student enviously complains of the
wealth and position which a successful actor derived from his calling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>England affords those glorious vagabonds,<br />
That carried erst their fardles on their backs,<br />
Coursers to ride on through the gazing streets,<br />
Sweeping it in their glaring satin suits,<br />
And pages to attend their masterships;<br />
<!-- page 199--><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

They purchase lands and now esquires are made. <a
name="citation199a"></a><a href="#footnote199a"
class="citation">[199a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The travelling actors, from whom the highwayman Gamaliel Ratsey extorted
a free performance in 1604, were represented as men with the certainty of a
rich competency in prospect. <a name="citation199b"></a><a
href="#footnote199b" class="citation">[199b]</a>&nbsp; An efficient actor
received in 1635 as large a regular salary as &pound;180.&nbsp; The lowest
known valuation set an actor&rsquo;s wages at 3s. a day, or about &pound;45
a year.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s emoluments as an actor before 1599 are
not likely to have fallen below &pound;100; while the remuneration due to
performances at Court or in noblemen&rsquo;s houses, if the accounts of
1594 be accepted as the basis of reckoning, added some &pound;15.</p>
<p>Thus over &pound;130 (equal to &pound;1,040 of to-day) would be
Shakespeare&rsquo;s average annual revenue before 1599.&nbsp; Such a sum
would be regarded as a very large income in a country town.&nbsp; According
to the author of &lsquo;Ratseis Ghost,&rsquo; the actor, who may well have
been meant for Shakespeare, practised in London a strict frugality, and
there seems no reason why Shakespeare should not have been able in 1597 to
draw from his <!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>savings &pound;60 wherewith to buy New
Place.&nbsp; His resources might well justify his fellow-townsmen&rsquo;s
opinion of his wealth in 1598, and suffice between 1597 and 1599 to meet
his expenses, in rebuilding the house, stocking the barns with grain, and
conducting various legal proceedings.&nbsp; But, according to tradition, he
had in the Earl of Southampton a wealthy and generous friend who on one
occasion gave him a large gift of money to enable &lsquo;him to go through
with&rsquo; a purchase to which he had a mind.&nbsp; A munificent gift,
added to professional gains, leaves nothing unaccounted for in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s financial position before 1599.</p>
<h3>Financial position after 1599.</h3>
<p>After 1599 his sources of income from the theatre greatly
increased.&nbsp; In 1635 the heirs of the actor Richard Burbage were
engaged in litigation respecting their proprietary rights in the two
playhouses, the Globe and the Blackfriars theatres.&nbsp; The documents
relating to this litigation supply authentic, although not very detailed,
information of Shakespeare&rsquo;s interest in theatrical property. <a
name="citation200"></a><a href="#footnote200"
class="citation">[200]</a>&nbsp; Richard Burbage, with his brother
Cuthbert, erected at their sole cost the Globe Theatre in the winter of
1598-9, and the Blackfriars Theatre, which their father was building at the
time of his death in 1597, was also their property.&nbsp; After completing
the Globe they leased out, for twenty-one years, shares in the receipts of
the theatre to &lsquo;those deserving men Shakespeare, <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Hemings, Condell,
Philips, and others.&rsquo;&nbsp; All the shareholders named were, like
Burbage, active members of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company of players.&nbsp;
The shares, which numbered sixteen in all, carried with them the obligation
of providing for the expenses of the playhouse, and were doubtless in the
first instance freely bestowed.&nbsp; Hamlet claims, in the play scene
(III. ii. 293), that the success of his improvised tragedy deserved to get
him &lsquo;a fellowship in a cry of players&rsquo;&mdash;a proof that a
successful dramatist might reasonably expect such a reward for a
conspicuous effort.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; moreover, both a share
and a half-share of &lsquo;a fellowship in a cry of players&rsquo; are
described as assets of enviable value (III. ii. 294-6).&nbsp; How many
shares originally fell to Shakespeare there is no means of
determining.&nbsp; Records of later subdivisions suggest that they did not
exceed two.&nbsp; The Globe was an exceptionally large and popular
playhouse.&nbsp; It would accommodate some two thousand spectators, whose
places cost them sums varying between twopence and half a crown.&nbsp; The
receipts were therefore considerable, hardly less than &pound;25 daily, or
some &pound;8,000 a year.&nbsp; According to the documents of 1635, an
actor-sharer at the Globe received above &pound;200 a year on each share,
besides his actor&rsquo;s salary of &pound;180.&nbsp; Thus Shakespeare drew
from the Globe Theatre, at the lowest estimate, more than &pound;500 a year
in all.</p>
<p>His interest in the Blackfriars Theatre was comparatively unimportant,
and is less easy to estimate.&nbsp; The often quoted documents on which
Collier depended to prove him a substantial shareholder in that <!-- page
202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>playhouse
have long been proved to be forgeries.&nbsp; The pleas in the lawsuit of
1635 show that the Burbages, the owners, leased the Blackfriars Theatre
after its establishment in 1597 for a long term of years to the master of
the Children of the Chapel, but bought out the lessee at the end of 1609,
and then &lsquo;placed&rsquo; in it &lsquo;men-players which were Hemings,
Condell, Shakespeare, etc.&rsquo;&nbsp; To these and other actors they
allotted shares in the receipts, the shares numbering eight in all.&nbsp;
The profits were far smaller than at the Globe, and if Shakespeare held one
share (certainty on the point is impossible), it added not more than
&pound;100 a year to his income, and that not until 1610.</p>
<h3>Later income.</h3>
<p>His remuneration as dramatist between 1599 and 1611 was also by no means
contemptible.&nbsp; Prices paid to dramatists for plays rose rapidly in the
early years of the seventeenth century, <a name="citation202"></a><a
href="#footnote202" class="citation">[202]</a> while the value of the
author&rsquo;s &lsquo;benefits&rsquo; grew with the growing vogue of the
theatre.&nbsp; The exceptional popularity of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays
after 1599 gave him the full advantage of higher rates of pecuniary reward
in all directions, and the seventeen plays which were produced by him
between that year and the close of his professional career in 1611 probably
brought him an average return of &pound;20 each or &pound;340 in
all&mdash;nearly &pound;30 a year.&nbsp; At the same time the increase in
the number of Court performances under James I, and the additional favour
bestowed on Shakespeare&rsquo;s <!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>company, may well have given that source of
income the enhanced value of &pound;20 a year. <a name="citation203"></a><a
href="#footnote203" class="citation">[203]</a></p>
<p>Thus Shakespeare in the later period of his life was earning above
&pound;600 a year in money of the period.&nbsp; With so large a
professional income he could easily, with good management, have completed
those purchases of houses and land at Stratford on which he laid out,
between 1599 and 1613, a total sum of &pound;970, or an annual average of
&pound;70.&nbsp; These properties, it must be remembered, represented
investments, and he drew rent from most of them.&nbsp; He traded, too, in
agricultural produce.&nbsp; There is nothing inherently improbable in the
statement of John Ward, the seventeenth-century vicar of Stratford, that in
his last years &lsquo;he spent at the rate of a thousand a year, as I have
heard,&rsquo; although we may reasonably make allowance for exaggeration in
the round figures.</p>
<h3>Incomes of fellow-actors.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare realised his theatrical shares several years before his
death in 1616, when he left, according to his will, &pound;350 in money in
addition to an extensive real estate and numerous personal
belongings.&nbsp; There was nothing exceptional in this comparative
affluence.&nbsp; His friends and fellow-actors, Heming and Condell, amassed
equally large, if not larger, fortunes.&nbsp; Burbage died in 1619 worth
&pound;300 in land, besides personal property; while a contemporary actor
and theatrical proprietor, Edward <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>Alleyn, purchased the
manor of Dulwich for &pound;10,000 (in money of his own day), and devoted
it, with much other property, to public uses, at the same time as he made
ample provision for his family out of the residue of his estate.&nbsp;
Gifts from patrons may have continued occasionally to augment
Shakespeare&rsquo;s resources, but his wealth can be satisfactorily
assigned to better attested agencies.&nbsp; There is no ground for treating
it as of mysterious origin. <a name="citation204a"></a><a
href="#footnote204a" class="citation">[204a]</a></p>
<h3>Formation of the estate at Stratford 1601-10.</h3>
<p>Between 1599 and 1611, while London remained Shakespeare&rsquo;s chief
home, he built up at Stratford a large landed estate which his purchase of
New Place had inaugurated.&nbsp; In 1601 his father died, being buried on
September 8.&nbsp; He apparently left no will, and the poet, as the eldest
son, inherited the houses in Henley Street, the only portion of the
property of the elder Shakespeare or of his wife which had not been
alienated to creditors.&nbsp; Shakespeare permitted his mother to reside in
one of the Henley Street houses till her death (she was buried September 9,
1608), and he derived a modest rent from the other.&nbsp; On May 1, 1602,
he purchased for &pound;320 of the rich landowners William and John Combe
of Stratford 107 acres of arable land near the town.&nbsp; The conveyance
was delivered, in the poet&rsquo;s absence, to his brother Gilbert,
&lsquo;to the use of the within named William Shakespere.&rsquo; <a
name="citation204b"></a><a href="#footnote204b"
class="citation">[204b]</a>&nbsp; A third purchase quickly followed.&nbsp;
On September 28, 1602, at a court baron of the manor of Rowington, one <!--
page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>Walter
Getley transferred to the poet a cottage and garden which were situated at
Chapel Lane, opposite the lower grounds of New Place.&nbsp; They were held
practically in fee-simple at the annual rental of 2s. 6d.&nbsp; It appears
from the roll that Shakespeare did not attend the manorial court held on
the day fixed for the transfer of the property at Rowington, and it was
consequently stipulated then that the estate should remain in the hands of
the lady of the manor until he completed the purchase in person.&nbsp; At a
later period he was admitted to the copyhold, and he settled the remainder
on his two daughters in fee.&nbsp; In April 1610 he purchased from the
Combes 20 acres of pasture land, to add to the 107 of arable land that he
had acquired of the same owners in 1602.</p>
<h3>The Stratford tithes.</h3>
<p>As early as 1598 Abraham Sturley had suggested that Shakespeare should
purchase the tithes of Stratford.&nbsp; Seven years later, on July 24,
1605, he bought for &pound;440 of Ralph Huband an unexpired term of
thirty-one years of a ninety-two years&rsquo; lease of a moiety of the
tithes of Stratford, Old Stratford, Bishopton, and Welcombe.&nbsp; The
moiety was subject to a rent of &pound;17 to the corporation, who were the
reversionary owners on the lease&rsquo;s expiration, and of &pound;5 to
John Barker, the heir of a former proprietor.&nbsp; The investment brought
Shakespeare, under the most favourable circumstances, no more than an
annuity of &pound;38, and the refusal of persons who claimed an interest in
the other moiety to acknowledge the full extent of their liability to the
corporation led that body to demand <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>from the poet
payments justly due from others.&nbsp; After 1609 he joined with two
interested persons, Richard Lane of Awston and Thomas Greene, the town
clerk of Stratford, in a suit in Chancery to determine the exact
responsibilities of all the tithe-owners, and in 1612 they presented a bill
of complaint to Lord-chancellor Ellesmere, with what result is
unknown.&nbsp; His acquisition of a part-ownership in the tithes was
fruitful in legal embarrassments.</p>
<h3>Recovery of small debts.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare inherited his father&rsquo;s love of litigation, and stood
rigorously by his rights in all his business relations.&nbsp; In March 1600
he recovered in London a debt of &pound;7 from one John Clayton.&nbsp; In
July 1604, in the local court at Stratford, he sued one Philip Rogers, to
whom he had supplied since the preceding March malt to the value of
&pound;1 19s. 10d, and had on June 25 lent 2s. in cash.&nbsp; Rogers paid
back 6s., and Shakespeare sought the balance of the account, &pound;1 15s.
10d.&nbsp; During 1608 and 1609 he was at law with another fellow-townsman,
John Addenbroke.&nbsp; On February 15, 1609, Shakespeare, who was
apparently represented by his solicitor and kinsman Thomas Greene, <a
name="citation206a"></a><a href="#footnote206a" class="citation">[206a]</a>
obtained judgment from a jury against Addenbroke for the payment of
&pound;6, and &pound;1 5s. costs, but Addenbroke left the town, and the
triumph proved barren.&nbsp; Shakespeare avenged himself by proceeding
against one Thomas Horneby, who had acted as the absconding debtor&rsquo;s
bail. <a name="citation206b"></a><a href="#footnote206b"

207</span>XIII&mdash;MATURITY OF GENIUS</h2>
<h3>Literary work in 1599.</h3>
<p>With an inconsistency that is more apparent than real, the astute
business transactions of these years (1597-1611) synchronise with the
production of Shakespeare&rsquo;s noblest literary work&mdash;of his most
sustained and serious efforts in comedy, tragedy, and romance.&nbsp; In
1599, after abandoning English history with &lsquo;Henry V,&rsquo; he
addressed himself to the composition of his three most perfect essays in
comedy&mdash;&lsquo;Much Ado about Nothing,&rsquo; &lsquo;As You Like
It,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Twelfth Night.&rsquo;&nbsp; Their good-humoured tone
seems to reveal their author in his happiest frame of mind; in each the
gaiety and tenderness of youthful womanhood are exhibited in fascinating
union; while Shakespeare&rsquo;s lyric gift bred no sweeter melodies than
the songs with which the three plays are interspersed.&nbsp; At the same
time each comedy enshrines such penetrating reflections on mysterious
problems of life as mark the stage of maturity in the growth of the
author&rsquo;s intellect.&nbsp; The first two of the three plays were
entered on the &lsquo;Stationers&rsquo; Registers&rsquo; before August 4,
1600, on which day a prohibition was set on their publication, as well as
on the publication of &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; and of Ben <!-- page 208--><a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Jonson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Every Man in his Humour.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was one of the many
efforts of the acting company to stop the publication of plays in the
belief that the practice was injurious to their rights.&nbsp; The effort
was only partially successful.&nbsp; &lsquo;Much Ado,&rsquo; like
&lsquo;Henry V,&rsquo; was published before the close of the year.&nbsp;
Neither &lsquo;As You Like It&rsquo; nor &lsquo;Twelfth Night,&rsquo;
however, was printed till it appeared in the Folio.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Much Ado.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In &lsquo;Much Ado,&rsquo; which appears to have been written in 1599,
the brilliant and spirited comedy of Benedick and Beatrice, and of the
blundering watchmen Dogberry and Verges, is wholly original; but the sombre
story of Hero and Claudio, about which the comic incident revolves, is
drawn from an Italian source, either from Bandello (novel. xxii.) through
Belleforest&rsquo;s &lsquo;Histoires Tragiques,&rsquo; or from
Ariosto&rsquo;s &lsquo;Orlando Furioso&rsquo; through Sir John
Harington&rsquo;s translation (canto v.)&nbsp; Ariosto&rsquo;s version, in
which the injured heroine is called Ginevra, and her lover Ariodante, had
been dramatised before.&nbsp; According to the accounts of the Court
revels, &lsquo;A Historie of Ariodante and Ginevra was showed before her
Majestie on Shrovetuesdaie at night&rsquo; in 1583. <a
name="citation208"></a><a href="#footnote208"
class="citation">[208]</a>&nbsp; Throughout Shakespeare&rsquo;s play the
ludicrous and serious aspects of humanity are blended with a convincing
naturalness.&nbsp; The popular comic actor William Kemp filled the role of
Dogberry, and Cowley appeared as Verges.&nbsp; In both the Quarto of 1600
and the Folio of 1623 these actors&rsquo; names are <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>prefixed by a
copyist&rsquo;s error to some of the speeches allotted to the two
characters (act iv. scene ii.)</p>
<h3>&lsquo;As You Like It.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;As You Like It,&rsquo; which quickly followed, is a dramatic
adaptation of Lodge&rsquo;s romance, &lsquo;Rosalynde, Euphues Golden
Legacie&rsquo; (1590), but Shakespeare added three new characters of
first-rate interest&mdash;Jaques, the meditative cynic; Touchstone, the
most carefully elaborated of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s fools; and the hoyden
Audrey.&nbsp; Hints for the scene of Orlando&rsquo;s encounter with Charles
the Wrestler, and for Touchstone&rsquo;s description of the diverse shapes
of a lie, were clearly drawn from a book called &lsquo;Saviolo&rsquo;s
Practise,&rsquo; a manual of the art of self-defence, which appeared in
1595 from the pen of Vincentio Saviolo, an Italian fencing-master in the
service of the Earl of Essex.&nbsp; None of Shakespeare&rsquo;s comedies
breathes a more placid temper or approaches more nearly to a pastoral
drama.&nbsp; Yet there is no lack of intellectual or poetic energy in the
enunciation of the contemplative philosophy which is cultivated in the
Forest of Arden.&nbsp; In Rosalind, Celia, Ph&oelig;be, and Audrey, four
types of youthful womanhood are contrasted with the liveliest humour.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Twelfth Night.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The date of &lsquo;Twelfth Night&rsquo; is probably 1600, and its name,
which has no reference to the story, doubtless commemorates the fact that
it was designed for a Twelfth Night celebration.&nbsp; &lsquo;The new map
with the augmentation of the Indies,&rsquo; spoken of by Maria (III. ii.
86), was a respectful reference to the great map of the world or
&lsquo;hydrographical description&rsquo; which was first issued with <!--
page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>Hakluyt&rsquo;s &lsquo;Voyages&rsquo; in 1599 or 1600, and first
disclosed the full extent of recent explorations of the
&lsquo;Indies&rsquo; in the New World and the Old. <a
name="citation210a"></a><a href="#footnote210a"
class="citation">[210a]</a>&nbsp; Like the &lsquo;Comedy of Errors,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Twelfth Night&rsquo; achieved the distinction, early in its career,
of a presentation at an Inn of Court.&nbsp; It was produced at Middle
Temple Hall on February 2, 1601-2, and Manningham, a barrister who was
present, described the performance. <a name="citation210b"></a><a
href="#footnote210b" class="citation">[210b]</a>&nbsp; Manningham wrote
that the piece was &lsquo;much like the &ldquo;Comedy of Errors&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Menechmi&rdquo; in Plautus, but most like and neere to that in
Italian called &ldquo;Inganni.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; Two sixteenth-century
Italian plays entitled &lsquo;Gl&rsquo; Inganni&rsquo; (&lsquo;The
Cheats&rsquo;), and a third called &lsquo;Gl&rsquo; Ingannati,&rsquo; bear
resemblance to &lsquo;Twelfth Night.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is possible that
Shakespeare had recourse to the last, which was based on Bandello&rsquo;s
novel of Nicuola, <a name="citation210c"></a><a href="#footnote210c"
class="citation">[210c]</a> was first published at Siena in 1538, and
became popular throughout Italy.&nbsp; But in all probability he drew the
story solely from the &lsquo;Historie of Apolonius and Silla,&rsquo; which
was related in &lsquo;Riche his Farewell to Militarie Profession&rsquo;
(1581).&nbsp; The author of that volume, Barnabe Riche, translated the tale
either direct from Bandello&rsquo;s Italian novel or from the French
rendering of Bandello&rsquo;s work in Belleforest&rsquo;s &lsquo;Histoires
Tragiques.&rsquo;&nbsp; Romantic pathos, <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>as in &lsquo;Much
Ado,&rsquo; is the dominant note of the main plot of &lsquo;Twelfth
Night,&rsquo; but Shakespeare neutralises the tone of sadness by his
mirthful portrayal of Malvolio, Sir Toby Belch, Sir Andrew Aguecheek,
Fabian, the clown Feste, and Maria, all of whom are his own
creations.&nbsp; The ludicrous gravity of Malvolio proved exceptionally
popular on the stage.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; 1601.</h3>
<p>In 1601 Shakespeare made a new departure by drawing a plot from
North&rsquo;s noble translation of Plutarch&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lives.&rsquo; <a
name="citation211a"></a><a href="#footnote211a"
class="citation">[211a]</a>&nbsp; Plutarch is the king of biographers, and
the deference which Shakespeare paid his work by adhering to the
phraseology wherever it was practicable illustrates his literary
discrimination.&nbsp; On Plutarch&rsquo;s lives of Julius C&aelig;sar,
Brutus, and Antony, Shakespeare based his historical tragedy of
&lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar.&rsquo;&nbsp; Weever, in 1601, in his
&lsquo;Mirror of Martyrs,&rsquo; plainly refers to the masterly speech in
the Forum at Ca&aelig;sar&rsquo;s funeral which Shakespeare put into
Antony&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp; There is no suggestion of the speech in
Plutarch; hence the composition of &lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo; may be
held to have preceded the issue of Weever&rsquo;s book in 1601.&nbsp; The
general topic was already familiar on the stage.&nbsp; Polonius told Hamlet
how, when he was at the university, he &lsquo;did enact Julius C&aelig;sar;
he was kill&rsquo;d in the Capitol: Brutus kill&rsquo;d him.&rsquo; <a
name="citation211b"></a><a href="#footnote211b"
class="citation">[211b]</a>&nbsp; A play of the same title was known as
early as 1589, and was acted in 1594 by Shakespeare&rsquo;s company.&nbsp;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s piece is a penetrating study of political life, and,
although the <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>murder and funeral of C&aelig;sar form the central episode and
not the climax, the tragedy is thoroughly well planned and balanced.&nbsp;
C&aelig;sar is ironically depicted in his dotage.&nbsp; The characters of
Brutus, Antony, and Cassius, the real heroes of the action, are exhibited
with faultless art.&nbsp; The fifth act, which presents the battle of
Philippi in progress, proves ineffective on the stage, but the reader never
relaxes his interest in the fortunes of the vanquished Brutus, whose death
is the catastrophe.</p>
<p>While &lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo; was winning its first laurels on
the stage, the fortunes of the London theatres were menaced by two
manifestations of unreasoning prejudice on the part of the public.&nbsp;
The earlier manifestation, although speciously the more serious, was in
effect innocuous.&nbsp; The puritans of the city of London had long
agitated for the suppression of all theatrical performances, and it seemed
as if the agitators triumphed when they induced the Privy Council on June
22, 1600, to issue to the officers of the Corporation of London and to the
justices of the peace of Middlesex and Surrey an order forbidding the
maintenance of more than two playhouses&mdash;one in Middlesex
(Alleyn&rsquo;s newly erected playhouse, the &lsquo;Fortune&rsquo; in
Cripplegate), and the other in Surrey (the &lsquo;Globe&rsquo; on the
Bankside).&nbsp; The contemplated restriction would have deprived very many
actors of employment, and driven others to seek a precarious livelihood in
the provinces.&nbsp; Happily, disaster was averted by the failure of the
municipal authorities and the magistrates of Surrey and Middlesex to make
the order operative.&nbsp; All the London <!-- page 213--><a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>theatres that were
already in existence went on their way unchecked. <a
name="citation213a"></a><a href="#footnote213a"
class="citation">[213a]</a></p>
<h3>The strife between adult and boy actors.</h3>
<p>More calamitous was a temporary reverse of fortune which
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company, in common with the other companies of adult
actors, suffered soon afterwards at the hands, not of fanatical enemies of
the drama, but of playgoers who were its avowed supporters.&nbsp; The
company of boy-actors, chiefly recruited from the choristers of the Chapel
Royal, and known as &lsquo;the Children of the Chapel,&rsquo; had since
1597 been installed at the new theatre in Blackfriars, and after 1600 the
fortunes of the veterans, who occupied rival stages, were put in jeopardy
by the extravagant outburst of public favour that the boys&rsquo;
performances evoked.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; the play which followed
&lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; Shakespeare pointed out the perils of the
situation. <a name="citation213b"></a><a href="#footnote213b"
class="citation">[213b]</a>&nbsp; The adult <!-- page 214--><a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>actors, Shakespeare
asserted, were prevented from performing in London through no falling off
in their efficiency, but by the &lsquo;late innovation&rsquo; of the
children&rsquo;s vogue. <a name="citation214a"></a><a href="#footnote214a"
class="citation">[214a]</a>&nbsp; They were compelled to go on tour in the
provinces, at the expense of their revenues and reputation, because
&lsquo;an aery [<i>i.e.</i> nest] of children, little eyases [<i>i.e.</i>
young hawks],&rsquo; dominated the theatrical world, and monopolised public
applause.&nbsp; &lsquo;These are now the fashion,&rsquo; the dramatist
lamented, <a name="citation214b"></a><a href="#footnote214b"
class="citation">[214b]</a> and he made the topic the text of a reflection
on the fickleness of public taste:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>.&nbsp; Do the boys carry it away?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rosencrantz</span>.&nbsp; Ay, that they do, my lord,
Hercules and his load too.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>.&nbsp; It is not very strange; for my
uncle is King of Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while my
father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his
picture in little.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jealousies in the ranks of the dramatists accentuated the actors&rsquo;
difficulties.&nbsp; Ben Jonson was, at the end of the sixteenth century,
engaged in a fierce personal quarrel with two of his fellow dramatists,
Marston and Dekker.&nbsp; The adult actors generally avowed sympathy with
Jonson&rsquo;s foes.&nbsp; Jonson, by way of revenge, sought an offensive
alliance with &lsquo;the Children of the Chapel.&rsquo;&nbsp; Under careful
tuition the boys proved capable of performing much the same pieces as the
men.&nbsp; To &lsquo;the children&rsquo; Jonson offered <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>in 1600 his comical
satire of &lsquo;Cynthia&rsquo;s Revels,&rsquo; in which he held up to
ridicule Dekker, Marston, and their actor-friends.&nbsp; The play, when
acted by &lsquo;the children&rsquo; at the Blackfriars Theatre, was warmly
welcomed by the audience.&nbsp; Next year Jonson repeated his
man&oelig;uvre with greater effect.&nbsp; He learnt that Marston and Dekker
were conspiring with the actors of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company to attack
him in a piece called &lsquo;Satiro-Mastix, or the Untrussing of the
Humourous Poet.&rsquo;&nbsp; He anticipated their design by producing,
again with &lsquo;the Children of the Chapel,&rsquo; his
&lsquo;Poetaster,&rsquo; which was throughout a venomous invective against
his enemies&mdash;dramatists and actors alike.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
company retorted by producing Dekker and Marston&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Satiro-Mastix&rsquo; at the Globe Theatre next year.&nbsp; But
Jonson&rsquo;s action had given new life to the vogue of the
children.&nbsp; Playgoers took sides in the struggle, and their attention
was for a season riveted, to the exclusion of topics more germane to their
province, on the actors&rsquo; and dramatists&rsquo; boisterous war of
personalities. <a name="citation215"></a><a href="#footnote215"
class="citation">[215]</a></p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s references to the struggle.</h3>
<p><!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>In his detailed references to the conflict in
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; Shakespeare protested against the abusive comments on
the men-actors of &lsquo;the common stages&rsquo; or public theatres which
were put into the children&rsquo;s mouths.&nbsp; Rosencrantz declared that
the children &lsquo;so berattle [<i>i.e.</i> assail] the common
stages&mdash;so they call them&mdash;that many wearing rapiers are afraid
of goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither [<i>i.e.</i> to the public
theatres].&rsquo;&nbsp; Hamlet in pursuit of the theme pointed out that the
writers who encouraged the vogue of the &lsquo;child-actors&rsquo; did them
a poor service, because when the boys should reach men&rsquo;s estate they
would run the risk, if they continued on the stage, of the same insults and
neglect which now threatened their seniors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>.&nbsp; What are they children?&nbsp;
Who maintains &rsquo;em? how are they escoted [<i>i.e.</i> paid]?&nbsp;
Will they pursue the quality [<i>i.e.</i> the actor&rsquo;s profession] no
longer than they can sing?&nbsp; Will they not say afterwards, if they
should grow themselves to common players&mdash;as it is most like, if their
means are no better&mdash;their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
against their own succession?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rosencrantz</span>.&nbsp; Faith, there has been much
to do on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to tarre [<i>i.e.</i>
incite] them to controversy: there was for a while no money bid for
argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>.&nbsp; Is it possible?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Guildenstern</span>.&nbsp; O, there has been much
throwing about of brains!</p>

217</span>Shakespeare clearly favoured the adult actors in their rivalry
with the boys, but he wrote more like a disinterested spectator than an
active partisan when he made specific reference to the strife between the
poet Ben Jonson and the players.&nbsp; In the prologue to &lsquo;Troilus
and Cressida&rsquo; which he penned in 1603, he warned his hearers, with
obvious allusion to Ben Jonson&rsquo;s battles, that he hesitated to
identify himself with either actor or poet. <a name="citation217"></a><a
href="#footnote217" class="citation">[217]</a>&nbsp; Passages in Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Poetaster,&rsquo; moreover, pointedly suggest that
Shakespeare cultivated so assiduously an attitude of neutrality that Jonson
acknowledged him to be qualified for the role of peacemaker.&nbsp; The
gentleness of disposition with which Shakespeare was invariably credited by
his friends would have well fitted him for such an office.</p>
<h3>Jonson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Poetaster.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Jonson figures personally in the &lsquo;Poetaster&rsquo; under the name
of Horace.&nbsp; Episodically Horace and his friends, Tibullus and Gallus,
eulogise the work and genius of another character, Virgil, in terms so
closely resembling those which Jonson is known to have applied to
Shakespeare that they may be regarded as intended to apply to him (act v.
sc. i.)&nbsp; Jonson points out that Virgil, by his penetrating intuition,
achieved the great effects which others laboriously sought to reach through
rules of art.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His learning labours not the school-like gloss<br />
That most consists of echoing words and terms . . .<br />
Nor any long or far-fetched circumstance&mdash;<br />
Wrapt in the curious generalities of arts&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 218--><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>But a direct and analytic sum<br />
Of all the worth and first effects of arts.<br />
And for his poesy, &rsquo;tis so rammed with life<br />
That it shall gather strength of life with being,<br />
And live hereafter, more admired than now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tibullus gives Virgil equal credit for having in his writings touched
with telling truth upon every vicissitude of human existence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That which he hath writ<br />
Is with such judgment laboured and distilled<br />
Through all the needful uses of our lives<br />
That, could a man remember but his lines,<br />
He should not touch at any serious point<br />
But he might breathe his spirit out of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Virgil in the play is nominated by C&aelig;sar to act as judge
between Horace and his libellers, and he advises the administration of
purging pills to the offenders.&nbsp; That course of treatment is adopted
with satisfactory results. <a name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a></p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s alleged partisanship.</h3>
<p>As against this interpretation, one contemporary witness has been held
to testify that Shakespeare stemmed the tide of Jonson&rsquo;s embittered
activity by no peace-making interposition, but by joining his foes, and by
administering to him, with their aid, the identical course of medicine
which in the &lsquo;Poetaster&rsquo; is meted out to his enemies.&nbsp; In
the same year (1601) as the &lsquo;Poetaster&rsquo; was produced,
&lsquo;The Return from Parnassus&rsquo;&mdash;a third piece in a trilogy of
plays&mdash;was &lsquo;acted <!-- page 219--><a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>by the students in St. John&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this piece, as in its two predecessors,
Shakespeare received, both as a playwright and a poet, high commendation,
although his poems were judged to reflect somewhat too largely
&lsquo;love&rsquo;s lazy foolish languishment.&rsquo;&nbsp; The actor
Burbage was introduced in his own name instructing an aspirant to the
actor&rsquo;s profession in the part of Richard the Third, and the familiar
lines from Shakespeare&rsquo;s play&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now is the winter of our discontent<br />
Made glorious summer by this sun of York&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are recited by the pupil as part of his lesson.&nbsp; Subsequently in a
prose dialogue between Shakespeare&rsquo;s fellow-actors Burbage and Kempe,
Kempe remarks of university dramatists, &lsquo;Why, here&rsquo;s our fellow
Shakespeare puts them all down; aye, and Ben Jonson, too.&nbsp; O! that Ben
Jonson is a pestilent fellow.&nbsp; He brought up Horace, giving the poets
a pill; but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him
bewray his credit.&rsquo;&nbsp; Burbage adds: &lsquo;He is a shrewd fellow
indeed.&rsquo;&nbsp; This perplexing passage has been held to mean that
Shakespeare took a decisive part against Jonson in the controversy with
Dekker and Dekker&rsquo;s actor friends.&nbsp; But such a conclusion is
nowhere corroborated, and seems to be confuted by the eulogies of Virgil in
the &lsquo;Poetaster&rsquo; and by the general handling of the theme in
&lsquo;Hamlet.&rsquo;&nbsp; The words quoted from &lsquo;The Return from
Parnassus&rsquo; hardly admit of a literal interpretation.&nbsp; Probably
the &lsquo;purge&rsquo; that Shakespeare was alleged by the author <!--
page 220--><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>of
&lsquo;The Return from Parnassus&rsquo; to have given Jonson meant no more
than that Shakespeare had signally outstripped Jonson in popular
esteem.&nbsp; As the author of &lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; he had
just proved his command of topics that were peculiarly suited to
Jonson&rsquo;s vein, <a name="citation220"></a><a href="#footnote220"
class="citation">[220]</a> and had in fact outrun his churlish comrade on
his own ground.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; 1602.</h3>
<p><!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>At any rate, in the tragedy that Shakespeare brought out in the
year following the production of &lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; he
finally left Jonson and all friends and foes lagging far behind both in
achievement and reputation.&nbsp; This new exhibition of the force of his
genius re-established, too, the ascendency of the adult actors who
interpreted his work, and the boys&rsquo; supremacy was quickly brought to
an end.&nbsp; In 1602 Shakespeare produced &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo;
&lsquo;that piece of his which most kindled English hearts.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The story of the Prince of Denmark had been popular on the stage as early
as 1589 in a lost dramatic version by another writer&mdash;doubtless Thomas
Kyd, whose tragedies of blood, &lsquo;The Spanish Tragedy&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Jeronimo,&rsquo; long held the Elizabethan stage.&nbsp; To that lost
version of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedy certainly owed
much. <a name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; The story was also accessible in the <!--
page 222--><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>&lsquo;Histoires Tragiques&rsquo; of Belleforest, who adapted it
from the &lsquo;Historia Danica&rsquo; of Saxo Grammaticus. <a
name="citation222"></a><a href="#footnote222"
class="citation">[222]</a>&nbsp; No English translation of
Belleforest&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hystorie of Hamblet&rsquo; appeared before 1608;
Shakespeare doubtless read it in the French.&nbsp; But his authorities give
little hint of what was to emerge from his study of them.</p>
<h3>The problem of its publication.</h3>
<h3>The First Quarto, 1603.</h3>
<p>Burbage created the title-part in Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedy, and its
success on the stage led to the play&rsquo;s publication immediately
afterwards.&nbsp; The bibliography of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; offers a
puzzling problem.&nbsp; On July 26, 1602, &lsquo;A Book called the Revenge
of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, as it was lately acted by the Lord
Chamberlain his Servants,&rsquo; was entered on the Stationers&rsquo;
Company&rsquo;s Registers, and it was published in quarto next year by
N[icholas] <!-- page 223--><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>L[ing] and John Trundell.&nbsp; The title-page stated that the
piece had been &lsquo;acted divers times in the city of London, as also in
the two Universities of Cambridge and Oxford and elsewhere.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The text here appeared in a rough and imperfect state.&nbsp; In all
probability it was a piratical and carelessly transcribed copy of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s first draft of the play, in which he drew largely on
the older piece.</p>
<h3>The Second Quarto, 1604.</h3>
<p>A revised version, printed from a more complete and accurate manuscript,
was published in 1604 as &lsquo;The Tragical History of Hamlet Prince of
Denmark, by William Shakespeare, newly imprinted and enlarged to almost as
much again as it was, according to the true and perfect copy.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This was printed by I[ames] R[oberts] for the publisher N[icholas]
L[ing].&nbsp; The concluding words&mdash;&lsquo;according to the true and
perfect copy&rsquo;&mdash;of the title-page of the second quarto were
intended to stamp its predecessor as surreptitious and unauthentic.&nbsp;
But it is clear that the Second Quarto was not a perfect version of the
play.&nbsp; It was itself printed from a copy which had been curtailed for
acting purposes.</p>
<h3>The Folio Version.</h3>
<p>A third version (long the <i>textus receptus</i>) figured in the Folio
of 1623.&nbsp; Here many passages, not to be found in the quartos, appear
for the first time, but a few others that appear in the quartos are
omitted.&nbsp; The Folio text probably came nearest to the original
manuscript; but it, too, followed an acting copy which had been abbreviated
somewhat less drastically than the Second Quarto and in a <!-- page
224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>different
fashion. <a name="citation224"></a><a href="#footnote224"
class="citation">[224]</a>&nbsp; Theobald in his &lsquo;Shakespeare
Restored&rsquo; (1726) made the first scholarly attempt to form a text from
a collation of the First Folio with the Second Quarto, and Theobald&rsquo;s
text with further embellishments by Sir Thomas Hanmer, Edward Capell, and
the Cambridge editors of 1866, is now generally adopted.</p>
<h3>Popularity of &lsquo;Hamlet.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; was the only drama by Shakespeare that was acted in
his lifetime at the two Universities.&nbsp; It has since attracted more
attention from actors, playgoers, and readers of all capacities than any
other of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays.&nbsp; Its world-wide popularity from
its author&rsquo;s day to our own, when it is as warmly welcomed in the
theatres of France and Germany as in those of England and America, is the
most striking of the many testimonies to the eminence of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s dramatic instinct.&nbsp; At a first glance there seems
little in the play to attract the uneducated or the unreflecting.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; is mainly a psychological effort, a study of the
reflective temperament in excess.&nbsp; The action develops slowly; at
times there is no movement at all.&nbsp; The piece is the longest of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, reaching a total of over 3,900 lines.&nbsp; It
is thus some nine hundred lines longer than &lsquo;Antony and
Cleopatra&rsquo;&mdash;the play by Shakespeare that approaches
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; more closely in numerical strength of lines.&nbsp; At
the same time the total length of Hamlet&rsquo;s speeches far <!-- page
225--><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>exceeds that
of those allotted by Shakespeare to any other of his characters.&nbsp;
Humorous relief is, it is true, effectively supplied to the tragic theme by
Polonius and the grave-diggers, and if the topical references to
contemporary theatrical history (II. ii. 350-89) could only count on an
appreciative reception from an Elizabethan audience, the pungent censure of
actors&rsquo; perennial defects is calculated to catch the ear of the
average playgoer of all ages.&nbsp; But it is not to these subsidiary
features that the universality of the play&rsquo;s vogue can be
attributed.&nbsp; It is the intensity of interest which Shakespeare
contrives to excite in the character of the hero that explains the position
of the play in popular esteem.&nbsp; The play&rsquo;s unrivalled power of
attraction lies in the pathetic fascination exerted on minds of almost
every calibre by the central figure&mdash;a high-born youth of chivalric
instincts and finely developed intellect, who, when stirred to avenge in
action a desperate private wrong, is foiled by introspective workings of
the brain that paralyse the will.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Troilus and Cressida.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Although the difficulties of determining the date of &lsquo;Troilus and
Cressida&rsquo; are very great, there are many grounds for assigning its
composition to the early days of 1603.&nbsp; In 1599 Dekker and Chettle
were engaged by Henslowe to prepare for the Earl of Nottingham&rsquo;s
company&mdash;a rival of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company&mdash;a play of
&lsquo;Troilus and Cressida,&rsquo; of which no trace survives.&nbsp; It
doubtless suggested the topic to Shakespeare.&nbsp; On February 7, 1602-3,
James Roberts obtained a license for &lsquo;the <!-- page 226--><a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>booke of Troilus and
Cresseda as yt is acted by my Lord Chamberlens men,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company. <a name="citation226a"></a><a
href="#footnote226a" class="citation">[226a]</a>&nbsp; Roberts printed the
Second Quarto of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; and others of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays; but his effort to publish &lsquo;Troilus&rsquo; proved abortive
owing to the interposition of the players.&nbsp; Roberts&rsquo;s
&lsquo;book&rsquo; was probably Shakespeare&rsquo;s play.&nbsp; The
metrical characteristics of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Troilus and
Cressida&rsquo;&mdash;the regularity of the blank verse&mdash;powerfully
confirm the date of composition which Roberts&rsquo;s license
suggests.&nbsp; Six years later, however, on January 28, 1608-9, a new
license for the issue of &lsquo;a booke called the history of Troylus and
Cressida&rsquo; was granted to other publishers, Richard Bonian and Henry
Walley, <a name="citation226b"></a><a href="#footnote226b"
class="citation">[226b]</a> and these publishers, more fortunate than
Roberts soon printed a quarto with Shakespeare&rsquo;s full name as
author.&nbsp; The text seems fairly authentic, but exceptional obscurity
attaches to the circumstances of the publication.&nbsp; Some copies of the
book bear an ordinary type of title-page stating that the piece was printed
&lsquo;as it was acted by the King&rsquo;s majesties servants at the
Globe.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in other copies, which differ in no way in regard
to the text of the play, there was substituted for this title-page a more
pretentious announcement running: &lsquo;The famous Historie of Troylus and
Cresseid, excellently expressing the beginning of their loues with the
conceited wooing of Pandarus, prince of Lacia.&rsquo;&nbsp; After this
pompous title-page there was inserted, for the first and only time in the
case of a play by Shakespeare that was <!-- page 227--><a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>published in his
lifetime, an advertisement or preface.&nbsp; In this interpolated page an
anonymous scribe, writing in the name of the publishers, paid bombastic and
high-flown compliments to Shakespeare as a writer of
&lsquo;comedies,&rsquo; and defiantly boasted that the &lsquo;grand
possessers&rsquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the owners&mdash;of the manuscript
deprecated its publication.&nbsp; By way of enhancing the value of what
were obviously stolen wares, it was falsely added that the piece was new
and unacted.&nbsp; This address was possibly the brazen reply of the
publishers to a more than usually emphatic protest on the part of players
or dramatist against the printing of the piece.&nbsp; The editors of the
Folio evinced distrust of the Quarto edition by printing their text from a
different copy showing many deviations, which were not always for the
better.</p>
<h3>Treatment of the theme.</h3>
<p>The work, which in point of construction shows signs of haste, and in
style is exceptionally unequal, is the least attractive of the efforts of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s middle life.&nbsp; The story is based on a romantic
legend of the Trojan war, which is of medi&aelig;val origin.&nbsp;
Shakespeare had possibly read Chapman&rsquo;s translation of Homer&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Iliad,&rsquo; but he owed his plot to Chaucer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Troilus
and Cresseid&rsquo; and Lydgate&rsquo;s &lsquo;Troy Book.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
defiance of his authorities he presented Cressida as a heartless coquette;
the poets who had previously treated her story&mdash;Boccaccio, Chaucer,
Lydgate, and Robert Henryson&mdash;had imagined her as a tender-hearted, if
frail, beauty, with claims on their pity rather than on their <!-- page
228--><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>scorn.&nbsp;
But Shakespeare&rsquo;s innovation is dramatically effective, and accords
with strictly moral canons.&nbsp; The charge frequently brought against the
dramatist that in &lsquo;Troilus and Cressida&rsquo; he cynically invested
the Greek heroes of classical antiquity with contemptible characteristics
is ill supported by the text of the play.&nbsp; Ulysses, Nestor, and
Agamemnon figure in Shakespeare&rsquo;s play as brave generals and
sagacious statesmen, and in their speeches Shakespeare concentrated a
marvellous wealth of pithily expressed philosophy, much of which has
fortunately obtained proverbial currency.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
conception of the Greeks followed traditional lines except in the case of
Achilles, whom he transforms into a brutal coward.&nbsp; And that portrait
quite legitimately interpreted the selfish, unreasoning, and exorbitant
pride with which the warrior was credited by Homer, and his imitators.</p>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s treatment of his theme cannot therefore be fairly
construed, as some critics construe it, into a petty-minded protest against
the honour paid to the ancient Greeks and to the form and sentiment of
their literature by more learned dramatists of the day, like Ben Jonson and
Chapman.&nbsp; Although Shakespeare knew the Homeric version of the Trojan
war, he worked in &lsquo;Troilus and Cressida&rsquo; upon a medi&aelig;val
romance, which was practically uninfluenced either for good or evil by the
classical spirit. <a name="citation228"></a><a href="#footnote228"

<h3>Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s death, March 26, 1603.</h3>
<p><!-- page 229--><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>Despite the association of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company with the
rebellion of 1601, and its difficulties with the children of the Chapel
Royal, he and his fellow actors <!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>retained their hold on Court favour till the
close of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; As late as February 2, 1603, the
company entertained the dying Queen at Richmond.&nbsp; Her death on March
26, 1603, drew from Shakespeare&rsquo;s early eulogist, Chettle, a vain
appeal to him under the fanciful name of Melicert, to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  Drop from his honied muse one sable teare,<br />
To mourne her death that grac&egrave;d his desert,<br />
And to his laies opened her royal eare. <a name="citation230"></a><a
href="#footnote230" class="citation">[230]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, except on sentimental grounds, the Queen&rsquo;s death justified no
lamentation on the part of Shakespeare.&nbsp; On the withdrawal of one
royal patron he and his friends at once found another, who proved far more
liberal and appreciative.</p>
<h3>James I&rsquo;s patronage.</h3>
<p>On May 19, 1603, James I, very soon after his accession, extended to
Shakespeare and other members of the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s company a
very marked and valuable recognition.&nbsp; To them he granted under royal
letters patent a license &lsquo;freely to use and exercise the arte and
facultie of playing comedies, tragedies, histories, enterludes, moralls,
pastoralles, stage-plaies, and such other like as they have already
studied, or hereafter shall use or studie as well for the recreation of our
loving subjectes as for our solace and pleasure, when we shall thinke good
to see them during our pleasure.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Globe Theatre was noted
as the customary scene of their labours, but permission was granted to them
to <!-- page 231--><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>perform in the town-hall or moot-hall of any country town.&nbsp;
Nine actors are named.&nbsp; Lawrence Fletcher stands first on the list; he
had already performed before James in Scotland in 1599 and 1601.&nbsp;
Shakespeare comes second and Burbage third.&nbsp; The company to which they
belonged was thenceforth styled the King&rsquo;s company; its members
became &lsquo;the King&rsquo;s Servants&rsquo; and they took rank with the
Grooms of the Chamber. <a name="citation231"></a><a href="#footnote231"
class="citation">[231]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were thenceforth
repeatedly performed in James&rsquo;s presence, and Oldys related that
James wrote Shakespeare a letter in his own hand, which was at one time in
the possession of Sir William D&rsquo;Avenant, and afterwards, according to
Lintot, in that of John Sheffield, first duke of Buckingham.</p>
<p>In the autumn and winter of 1603 the prevalence of the plague led to the
closing of the theatres in London.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s players were
compelled to make a prolonged tour in the provinces, which entailed some
loss of income.&nbsp; For two months from the third week in October, the
Court was temporarily installed at Wilton, the residence of William
Herbert, third earl of Pembroke, and late in November the company was
summoned by the royal officers <!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>to perform in the royal presence.&nbsp; The
actors travelled from Mortlake to Salisbury &lsquo;unto the Courte
aforesaide,&rsquo; and their performance took place at Wilton House on
December 2.&nbsp; They received next day &lsquo;upon the Councells
warrant&rsquo; the large sum of &pound;30 &lsquo;by way of his majesties
reward.&rsquo; <a name="citation232a"></a><a href="#footnote232a"
class="citation">[232a]</a>&nbsp; Many other gracious marks of royal favour
followed.&nbsp; On March 15, 1604, Shakespeare and eight other actors of
the company walked from the Tower of London to Westminster in the
procession which accompanied the King on his formal entry into
London.&nbsp; Each actor received four and a half yards of scarlet cloth to
wear as a cloak on the occasion, and in the document authorising the grant
Shakespeare&rsquo;s name stands first on the list. <a
name="citation232b"></a><a href="#footnote232b"
class="citation">[232b]</a>&nbsp; The dramatist Dekker was author of a
somewhat bombastic account of the elaborate ceremonial, which rapidly ran
through three editions.&nbsp; On <!-- page 233--><a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>April 9, 1604, the
King gave further proof of his friendly interest in the fortunes of his
actors by causing an official letter to be sent to the Lord Mayor of London
and the Justices of the Peace for Middlesex and Surrey, bidding them
&lsquo;permit and suffer&rsquo; the King&rsquo;s players to &lsquo;exercise
their playes&rsquo; at their &lsquo;usual house,&rsquo; the Globe. <a
name="citation233a"></a><a href="#footnote233a"
class="citation">[233a]</a>&nbsp; Four months later&mdash;in
August&mdash;every member of the company was summoned by the King&rsquo;s
order to attend at Somerset House during the fortnight&rsquo;s sojourn
there of the Spanish ambassador extraordinary, Juan Fernandez de Velasco,
duke de Frias, and Constable of Castile, who came to London to ratify the
treaty of peace between England and Spain, and was magnificently
entertained by the English Court. <a name="citation233b"></a><a

235</span>XIV&mdash;THE HIGHEST THEMES OF TRAGEDY</h2>
<h3>&lsquo;Othello&rsquo; and &lsquo;Measure for Measure.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Under the incentive of such exalted patronage, Shakespeare&rsquo;s
activity redoubled, but his work shows none of the conventional marks of
literature that is produced in the blaze of Court favour.&nbsp; The first
six years of the new reign saw him absorbed in the highest themes of
tragedy, and an unparalleled intensity and energy, which bore few traces of
the trammels of a Court, thenceforth illumined every scene that he
contrived.&nbsp; To 1604 the composition of two plays can be confidently
assigned, one of which&mdash;&lsquo;Othello&rsquo;&mdash;ranks with
Shakespeare&rsquo;s greatest achievements; while the
other&mdash;&lsquo;Measure for Measure&rsquo;&mdash;although as a whole far
inferior to &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; contains one of the finest scenes
(between Angelo and Isabella, II. ii. 43 sq.) and one of the greatest
speeches (Claudio on the fear of death, III. i. 116-30) in the range of
Shakespearean drama.&nbsp; &lsquo;Othello&rsquo; was doubtless the first
new piece by Shakespeare that was acted before James.&nbsp; It was produced
at Whitehall on November 1.&nbsp; &lsquo;Measure for Measure&rsquo;
followed on December 26. <a name="citation235"></a><a href="#footnote235"
class="citation">[235]</a>&nbsp; Neither was printed in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
<!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>lifetime.&nbsp; The plots of both ultimately come from the same
Italian collection of novels&mdash;Giraldi Cinthio&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Hecatommithi,&rsquo; which was first published in 1565.</p>
<p>Cinthio&rsquo;s painful story of &lsquo;Othello&rsquo; (decad. iii. nov.
3) is not known to have been translated into English before Shakespeare
dramatised it.&nbsp; He followed its main drift with fidelity, but he
introduced the new characters of Roderigo and Emilia, and he invested the
catastrophe with new and fearful intensity by making Iago&rsquo;s cruel
treachery known to Othello at the last, after Iago&rsquo;s perfidy has
impelled the noble-hearted Moor in his groundless jealousy to murder his
gentle and innocent wife Desdemona.&nbsp; Iago became in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s hands the subtlest of all studies of intellectual
villainy and hypocrisy.&nbsp; The whole tragedy displays to magnificent
advantage the dramatist&rsquo;s fully matured powers.&nbsp; An unfaltering
<!-- page 237--><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>equilibrium is maintained in the treatment of plot and characters
alike.</p>
<p>Cinthio made the perilous story of &lsquo;Measure for Measure&rsquo; the
subject not only of a romance, but of a tragedy called
&lsquo;Epitia.&rsquo;&nbsp; Before Shakespeare wrote his play,
Cinthio&rsquo;s romance had been twice rendered into English by George
Whetstone.&nbsp; Whetstone had not only given a somewhat altered version of
the Italian romance in his unwieldy play of &lsquo;Promos and
Cassandra&rsquo; (in two parts of five acts each, 1578), but he had also
freely translated it in his collection of prose tales, &lsquo;Heptameron of
Civil Discources&rsquo; (1582).&nbsp; Yet there is every likelihood that
Shakespeare also knew Cinthio&rsquo;s play, which, unlike his romance, was
untranslated; the leading character, who is by Shakespeare christened
Angelo, was known by another name to Cinthio in his story, but Cinthio in
his play (and not in his novel) gives the character a sister named Angela,
which doubtless suggested Shakespeare&rsquo;s designation. <a
name="citation237"></a><a href="#footnote237"
class="citation">[237]</a>&nbsp; In the hands of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
predecessors the tale is a sordid record of lust and cruelty.&nbsp; But
Shakespeare prudently showed scant respect for their handling of the
narrative.&nbsp; By diverting the course of the plot at a critical point he
not merely proved his artistic ingenuity, but gave dramatic dignity and
moral elevation to a degraded and repellent theme.&nbsp; In the old
versions Isabella yields her virtue as the price of her brother&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; The central fact of Shakespeare&rsquo;s play is
Isabella&rsquo;s inflexible and unconditional chastity.&nbsp; Other of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>alterations, like the Duke&rsquo;s abrupt
proposal to marry Isabella, seem hastily conceived.&nbsp; But his creation
of the pathetic character of Mariana &lsquo;of the moated
grange&rsquo;&mdash;the legally affianced bride of Angelo, Isabella&rsquo;s
would-be seducer&mdash;skilfully excludes the possibility of a settlement
(as in the old stories) between Isabella and Angelo on terms of
marriage.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s argument is throughout philosophically
subtle.&nbsp; The poetic eloquence in which Isabella and the Duke pay
homage to the virtue of chastity, and the many expositions of the
corruption with which unchecked sexual passion threatens society, alternate
with coarsely comic interludes which suggest the vanity of seeking to
efface natural instincts by the coercion of law.&nbsp; There is little in
the play that seems designed to recommend it to the Court before which it
was first performed.&nbsp; But the two emphatic references to a
ruler&rsquo;s dislike of mobs, despite his love of his people, were perhaps
penned in deferential allusion to James I, whose horror of crowds was
notorious.&nbsp; In act i. sc. i. 67-72 the Duke remarks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I love the people,<br
/>
But do not like to stage me to their eyes.<br />
Though it do well, I do not relish well<br />
Their loud applause and aves vehement.<br />
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion<br />
That does affect it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of like tenor is the succeeding speech of Angelo (act ii. sc. iv.
27-30):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The general [<i>i.e.</i> the public], subject to a well-wish&rsquo;d
king, . . .<br />
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love<br />
Must needs appear offence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&lsquo;Macbeth.&rsquo;</h3>
<p><!-- page 239--><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>In &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo; his &lsquo;great epic drama,&rsquo;
which he began in 1605 and completed next year, Shakespeare employed a
setting wholly in harmony with the accession of a Scottish king.&nbsp; The
story was drawn from Holinshed&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chronicle of Scottish
History,&rsquo; with occasional reference, perhaps, to earlier Scottish
sources. <a name="citation239"></a><a href="#footnote239"
class="citation">[239]</a>&nbsp; The supernatural machinery of the three
witches accorded with the King&rsquo;s superstitious faith in demonology;
the dramatist lavished his sympathy on Banquo, James&rsquo;s ancestor;
while Macbeth&rsquo;s vision of kings who carry &lsquo;twofold balls and
treble sceptres&rsquo; (iv. i. 20) plainly adverted to the union of
Scotland with England and Ireland under James&rsquo;s sway.&nbsp; The
allusion by the porter (ii. iii. 9) to the &lsquo;equivocator . . . who
committed treason&rsquo; was perhaps suggested by the notorious defence of
the doctrine of equivocation made by the Jesuit Henry Garnett, who was
executed early in 1606 for his share in the &lsquo;Gunpowder
Plot.&rsquo;&nbsp; The piece was not printed until 1623.&nbsp; It is in its
existing shape by far the shortest of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies,
(&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; is nearly twice as long) and it is possible that it
survives only in an abbreviated acting version.&nbsp; Much scenic
elaboration characterised the production.&nbsp; Dr. Simon Forman witnessed
a performance of the tragedy at the Globe in April 1611, and noted that
Macbeth and Banquo entered the stage on horseback, and that Banquo&rsquo;s
ghost was materially represented (iii. iv. 40 seq.)&nbsp; Like
&lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; the play ranks with the noblest tragedies either of
the modern or the ancient world.&nbsp; The characters of hero and
heroine<!-- page 240--><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>&mdash;Macbeth and his wife&mdash;are depicted with the utmost
subtlety and insight.&nbsp; In three points &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; differs
somewhat from other of Shakespeare&rsquo;s productions in the great class
of literature to which it belongs.&nbsp; The interweaving with the tragic
story of supernatural interludes in which Fate is weirdly personified is
not exactly matched in any other of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies.&nbsp; In
the second place, the action proceeds with a rapidity that is wholly
without parallel in the rest of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays.&nbsp; Nowhere,
moreover, has Shakespeare introduced comic relief into a tragedy with
bolder effect than in the porter&rsquo;s speech after the murder of Duncan
(II. iii. I seq.)&nbsp; The theory that this passage was from another hand
does not merit acceptance. <a name="citation240"></a><a href="#footnote240"
class="citation">[240]</a>&nbsp; It cannot, however, be overlooked that the
second scene of the first act&mdash;Duncan&rsquo;s interview with the
&lsquo;bleeding sergeant&rsquo;&mdash;falls so far below the style of the
rest of the play as to suggest that it was an interpolation by a hack of
the theatre.&nbsp; The resemblances between Thomas Middleton&rsquo;s later
play of &lsquo;The Witch&rsquo; (1610) and portions of
&lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; may safely be ascribed to plagiarism on
Middleton&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; Of two songs which, according to the stage
directions, were to be sung during the representation of
&lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; (III. v. and IV. i.), only the first line of each is
noted there, but songs beginning with the same lines are set out in full in
Middleton&rsquo;s play; they were probably by Middleton, and were
interpolated by actors in a stage version of &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; after
its original production.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;King Lear.&rsquo;</h3>
<p><!-- page 241--><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&lsquo;King Lear,&rsquo; in which Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragic
genius moved without any faltering on Titanic heights, was written during
1606, and was produced before the Court at Whitehall on the night of
December 26 of that year. <a name="citation241a"></a><a
href="#footnote241a" class="citation">[241a]</a>&nbsp; It was entered on
the &lsquo;Stationers&rsquo; Registers&rsquo; on November 26, 1607, and two
imperfect editions, published by Nathaniel Butter, appeared in the
following year; neither exactly corresponds with the other or with the
improved and fairly satisfactory text of the Folio.&nbsp; The three
versions present three different playhouse transcripts.&nbsp; Like its
immediate predecessor, &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo; the tragedy was mainly
founded on Holinshed&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chronicle.&rsquo;&nbsp; The leading
theme had been dramatised as early as 1593, but Shakespeare&rsquo;s
attention was no doubt directed to it by the publication of a crude
dramatic adaptation of Holinshed&rsquo;s version in 1605 under the title of
&lsquo;The True Chronicle History of King Leir and his three
Daughters&mdash;Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordella.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare did
not adhere closely to his original.&nbsp; He invested the tale of Lear with
a hopelessly tragic conclusion, and on it he grafted the equally
distressing tale of Gloucester and his two sons, which he drew from
Sidney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Arcadia.&rsquo; <a name="citation241b"></a><a
href="#footnote241b" class="citation">[241b]</a>&nbsp; Hints for the
speeches of Edgar when feigning madness were drawn from Harsnet&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Declaration of Popish <!-- page 242--><a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>Impostures,&rsquo; 1603.&nbsp; In every act of
&lsquo;Lear&rsquo; the pity and terror of which tragedy is capable reach
their climax.&nbsp; Only one who has something of the Shakespearean gift of
language could adequately characterise the scenes of agony&mdash;&lsquo;the
living martyrdom&rsquo;&mdash;to which the fiendish ingratitude of his
daughters condemns the abdicated king&mdash;&lsquo;a very foolish, fond old
man, fourscore and upward.&rsquo;&nbsp; The elemental passions burst forth
in his utterances with all the vehemence of the volcanic tempest which
beats about his defenceless head in the scene on the heath.&nbsp; The
brutal blinding of Gloucester by Cornwall exceeds in horror any other
situation that Shakespeare created, if we assume that he was not
responsible for the like scenes of mutilation in &lsquo;Titus
Andronicus.&rsquo;&nbsp; At no point in &lsquo;Lear&rsquo; is there any
loosening of the tragic tension.&nbsp; The faithful half-witted lad who
serves the king as his fool plays the jesting chorus on his master&rsquo;s
fortunes in penetrating earnest and deepens the desolating pathos.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Timon of Athens.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Although Shakespeare&rsquo;s powers showed no sign of exhaustion, he
reverted in the year following the colossal effort of &lsquo;Lear&rsquo;
(1607) to his earlier habit of collaboration, and with another&rsquo;s aid
composed two dramas&mdash;&lsquo;Timon of Athens&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Pericles.&rsquo;&nbsp; An extant play on the subject of &lsquo;Timon
of Athens&rsquo; was composed in 1600, <a name="citation242"></a><a
href="#footnote242" class="citation">[242]</a> but there is nothing to show
that Shakespeare and his coadjutor were acquainted with it.&nbsp; They
doubtless derived a part <!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>of their story from Painter&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Palace of Pleasure,&rsquo; and from a short digression in
Plutarch&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of Marc Antony,&rsquo; where Antony is
described as emulating the life and example of &lsquo;Timon Misanthropos
the Athenian.&rsquo;&nbsp; The dramatists may, too, have known a dialogue
of Lucian entitled &lsquo;Timon,&rsquo; which Boiardo had previously
converted into a comedy under the name of &lsquo;Il Timone.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Internal evidence makes it clear that Shakespeare&rsquo;s colleague was
responsible for nearly the whole of acts III. and V.&nbsp; But the
character of Timon himself and all the scenes which he dominates are from
Shakespeare&rsquo;s pen.&nbsp; Timon is cast in the mould of Lear.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Pericles.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>There seems some ground for the belief that Shakespeare&rsquo;s
coadjutor in &lsquo;Timon&rsquo; was George Wilkins, a writer of
ill-developed dramatic power, who, in &lsquo;The Miseries of Enforced
Marriage&rsquo; (1607), first treated the story that afterwards served for
the plot of &lsquo;The Yorkshire Tragedy.&rsquo;&nbsp; At any rate, Wilkins
may safely be credited with portions of &lsquo;Pericles,&rsquo; a romantic
play which can be referred to the same year as &lsquo;Timon.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Shakespeare contributed only acts III. and V. and parts of IV., which
together form a self-contained whole, and do not combine satisfactorily
with the remaining scenes.&nbsp; The presence of a third hand, of inferior
merit to Wilkins, has been suspected, and to this collaborator (perhaps
William Rowley, a professional reviser of plays who could show capacity on
occasion) are best assigned the three scenes of purposeless coarseness
which take place in or before a brothel (IV. ii., v. and vi.)&nbsp; <!--
page 244--><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>From so
distributed a responsibility the piece naturally suffers.&nbsp; It lacks
homogeneity, and the story is helped out by dumb shows and prologues.&nbsp;
But a matured felicity of expression characterises Shakespeare&rsquo;s own
contributions, narrating the romantic quest of Pericles for his daughter
Marina, who was born and abandoned in a shipwreck.&nbsp; At many points he
here anticipated his latest dramatic effects.&nbsp; The shipwreck is
depicted (IV. i.) as impressively as in the &lsquo;Tempest,&rsquo; and
Marina and her mother Thaisa enjoy many experiences in common with Perdita
and Hermione in the &lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale.&rsquo;&nbsp; The prologues,
which were not by Shakespeare, were spoken by an actor representing the
medi&aelig;val poet John Gower, who in the fourteenth century had versified
Pericles&rsquo;s story in his &lsquo;Confessio Amantis&rsquo; under the
title of &lsquo;Apollonius of Tyre.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is also found in a
prose translation (from the French), which was printed in Lawrence
Twyne&rsquo;s &lsquo;Patterne of Painfull Adventures&rsquo; in 1576, and
again in 1607.&nbsp; After the play was produced, George Wilkins, one of
the alleged coadjutors, based on it a novel called &lsquo;The Painful
Adventures of Pericles, Prynce of Tyre, being the True History of the Play
of Pericles as it was lately presented by the worthy and ancient Poet, John
Gower&rsquo; (1608).&nbsp; The play was issued as by William Shakespeare in
a mangled form in 1608, and again in 1611, 1619, 1630, and 1635.&nbsp; It
was not included in Shakespeare&rsquo;s collected works till 1664.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Antony and Cleopatra.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In May 1608 Edward Blount entered in the <!-- page 245--><a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>&lsquo;Stationers&rsquo; Registers,&rsquo; by the authority of
Sir George Buc, the licenser of plays, &lsquo;a booke called &ldquo;Anthony
and Cleopatra.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; No copy of this date is known, and once
again the company probably hindered the publication.&nbsp; The play was
first printed in the folio of 1623.&nbsp; The source of the tragedy is the
life of Antonius in North&rsquo;s &lsquo;Plutarch.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare
closely followed the historical narrative, and assimilated not merely its
temper, but, in the first three acts, much of its phraseology.&nbsp; A few
short scenes are original, but there is no detail in such a passage, for
example, as Enobarbus&rsquo;s gorgeous description of the pageant of
Cleopatra&rsquo;s voyage up the Cydnus to meet Antony (II. ii. 194 seq.),
which is not to be matched in Plutarch.&nbsp; In the fourth and fifth acts
Shakespeare&rsquo;s method changes and he expands his material with
magnificent freedom. <a name="citation245"></a><a href="#footnote245"
class="citation">[245]</a>&nbsp; The whole theme is in his hands instinct
with a dramatic grandeur which lifts into sublimity even Cleopatra&rsquo;s
moral worthlessness and Antony&rsquo;s criminal infatuation.&nbsp; The
terse and caustic comments which Antony&rsquo;s level-headed friend
Enobarbus, in the r&ocirc;le of chorus, passes on the action accentuate its
significance.&nbsp; Into the smallest as into the greatest personages
Shakespeare breathed all his vitalising fire.&nbsp; The &lsquo;happy
valiancy&rsquo; of the style, too&mdash;to use Coleridge&rsquo;s admirable
phrase&mdash;sets the tragedy very near the zenith of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
achievement, and while differentiating it <!-- page 246--><a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>from
&lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo; &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lear,&rsquo;
renders it a very formidable rival.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Coriolanus.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;Coriolanus&rsquo; (first printed from a singularly bad text in
1623) similarly owes its origin to the biography of the hero in
North&rsquo;s &lsquo;Plutarch,&rsquo; although Shakespeare may have first
met the story in Painter&rsquo;s &lsquo;Palace of Pleasure&rsquo; (No.
iv.)&nbsp; He again adhered to the text of Plutarch with the utmost
literalness, and at times&mdash;even in the great crises of the
action&mdash;repeated North&rsquo;s translation word for word. <a
name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a>&nbsp; But the humorous scenes are wholly of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s invention, and the course of the narrative was at times
slightly changed for purposes of dramatic effect.&nbsp; The metrical
characteristics prove the play to have been written about the same period
as &lsquo;Antony and <!-- page 247--><a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>Cleopatra,&rsquo; probably in 1609.&nbsp; In
its austere temper it contrasts at all points with its predecessor.&nbsp;
The courageous self-reliance of Coriolanus&rsquo;s mother, Volumnia, is
severely contrasted with the submissive gentleness of Virgilia,
Coriolanus&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; The hero falls a victim to no sensual flaw,
but to unchecked pride of caste, and there is a searching irony in the
emphasis laid on the ignoble temper of the rabble, who procure his
overthrow.&nbsp; By way of foil, the speeches of Menenius give dignified
expression to the maturest political wisdom.&nbsp; The dramatic interest
throughout is as single and as unflaggingly sustained as in
&lsquo;Othello.&rsquo;</p>

248</span>XV&mdash;THE LATEST PLAYS</h2>
<h3>The latest plays.</h3>
<p>In &lsquo;Cymbeline,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;The Tempest,&rsquo; the three latest plays that came from his
unaided pen, Shakespeare dealt with romantic themes which all end happily,
but he instilled into them a pathos which sets them in a category of their
own apart alike from comedy and tragedy.&nbsp; The placidity of tone
conspicuous in these three plays (none of which was published in his
lifetime) has been often contrasted with the storm and stress of the great
tragedies that preceded them.&nbsp; But the commonly accepted theory that
traces in this change of tone a corresponding development in the
author&rsquo;s own emotions ignores the objectivity of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
dramatic work.&nbsp; All phases of feeling lay within the scope of his
intuition, and the successive order in which he approached them bore no
explicable relation to substantive incident in his private life or
experience.&nbsp; In middle life, his temperament, like that of other men,
acquired a larger measure of gravity and his thought took a profounder cast
than characterised it in youth.&nbsp; The highest topics of tragedy were
naturally more congenial to him, and <!-- page 249--><a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>were certain of a
surer handling when he was nearing his fortieth birthday than at an earlier
age.&nbsp; The serenity of meditative romance was more in harmony with the
fifth decade of his years than with the second or third.&nbsp; But no more
direct or definite connection can be discerned between the progressive
stages of his work and the progressive stages of his life.&nbsp; To seek in
his biography for a chain of events which should be calculated to stir in
his own soul all or any of the tempestuous passions that animate his
greatest plays is to under-estimate and to misapprehend the resistless
might of his creative genius.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Cymbeline.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>In &lsquo;Cymbeline&rsquo; Shakespeare freely adapted a fragment of
British history taken from Holinshed, interweaving with it a story from
Boccaccio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Decameron&rsquo; (day 2, novel ix.)&nbsp; Ginevra,
whose falsely suspected chastity is the theme of the Italian novel,
corresponds to Shakespeare&rsquo;s Imogen.&nbsp; Her story is also told in
the tract called &lsquo;Westward for Smelts,&rsquo; which had already been
laid under contribution by Shakespeare in the &lsquo;Merry Wives.&rsquo; <a
name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249"
class="citation">[249]</a>&nbsp; The by-plot of the banishment of the lord,
Belarius, who in revenge for his expatriation kidnapped the king&rsquo;s
young sons and brought them up with him in the recesses of the mountains,
is Shakespeare&rsquo;s invention.&nbsp; Although most of the scenes are
laid in Britain in the first century before the Christian era, there is no
pretence of historical vraisemblance.&nbsp; With an almost ludicrous
inappropriateness <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>the British king&rsquo;s courtiers make merry
with technical terms peculiar to Calvinistic theology, like
&lsquo;grace&rsquo; and &lsquo;election.&rsquo; <a
name="citation250"></a><a href="#footnote250"
class="citation">[250]</a>&nbsp; The action, which, owing to the
combination of three threads of narrative, is exceptionally varied and
intricate, wholly belongs to the region of romance.&nbsp; On Imogen, who is
the central figure of the play, Shakespeare lavished all the fascination of
his genius.&nbsp; She is the crown and flower of his conception of tender
and artless womanhood.&nbsp; Her husband Posthumus, her rejected lover
Cloten, her would-be seducer Iachimo are contrasted with her and with each
other with consummate ingenuity.&nbsp; The mountainous retreat in which
Belarius and his fascinating boy-companions play their part has points of
resemblance to the Forest of Arden in &lsquo;As You Like It;&rsquo; but
life throughout &lsquo;Cymbeline&rsquo; is grimly earnest, and the
mountains nurture little of the contemplative quiet which characterises
existence in the Forest of Arden.&nbsp; The play contains the splendid
lyric &lsquo;Fear no more the heat of the sun&rsquo; (IV. ii. 258
seq.)&nbsp; The &lsquo;pitiful mummery&rsquo; of the vision of Posthumus
(V. iv. 30 seq.) must have been supplied by another hand.&nbsp; Dr. Forman,
the astrologer who kept notes of some of his experiences as a playgoer, saw
&lsquo;Cymbeline&rsquo; acted either in 1610 or 1611.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;A Winter&rsquo;s Tale.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>&lsquo;A Winter&rsquo;s Tale&rsquo; was seen by Dr. Forman at the Globe
on May 15, 1611, and it appears to <!-- page 251--><a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>have been acted at
court on November 5 following. <a name="citation251a"></a><a
href="#footnote251a" class="citation">[251a]</a>&nbsp; It is based upon
Greene&rsquo;s popular romance which was called &lsquo;Pandosto&rsquo; in
the first edition of 1588, and in numerous later editions, but was
ultimately in 1648 re-christened &lsquo;Dorastus and Fawnia.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Shakespeare followed Greene, his early foe, in allotting a seashore to
Bohemia&mdash;an error over which Ben Jonson and many later critics have
made merry. <a name="citation251b"></a><a href="#footnote251b"
class="citation">[251b]</a>&nbsp; A few lines were obviously drawn from
that story of Boccaccio with which Shakespeare had dealt just before in
&lsquo;Cymbeline.&rsquo; <a name="citation251c"></a><a href="#footnote251c"
class="citation">[251c]</a>&nbsp; But Shakespeare created the high-spirited
Paulina and the thievish pedlar Autolycus, whose seductive roguery has
become proverbial, and he invented the reconciliation of Leontes, the
irrationally jealous husband, with Hermione, his wife, whose dignified
resignation and forbearance lend the story its intense pathos.&nbsp; In the
boy Mamilius, the poet depicted childhood in its most attractive guise,
while the courtship of Florizel and Perdita is the perfection of gentle
romance.&nbsp; The freshness of the pastoral incident surpasses that of all
Shakespeare&rsquo;s presentations of country life.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Tempest.&rsquo;</h3>
<p><!-- page 252--><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>&lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; was probably the latest drama that
Shakespeare completed.&nbsp; In the summer of 1609 a fleet bound for
Virginia, under the command of Sir George Somers, was overtaken by a storm
off the West Indies, and the admiral&rsquo;s ship, the
&lsquo;Sea-Venture,&rsquo; was driven on the coast of the hitherto unknown
Bermuda Isles.&nbsp; There they remained ten months, pleasurably impressed
by the mild beauty of the climate, but sorely tried by the hogs which
overran the island and by mysterious noises which led them to imagine that
spirits and devils had made the island their home.&nbsp; Somers and his men
were given up for lost, but they escaped from Bermuda in two boats of cedar
to Virginia in May 1610, and the news of their adventures and of their
safety was carried to England by some of the seamen in September
1610.&nbsp; The sailors&rsquo; arrival created vast public excitement in
London.&nbsp; At least five accounts were soon published of the shipwreck
and of the mysterious island, previously uninhabited by man, which had
proved the salvation of the expedition.&nbsp; &lsquo;A Discovery of the
Bermudas, otherwise called the Ile of Divels,&rsquo; written by Sylvester
Jourdain or Jourdan, one of the survivors, appeared as early as
October.&nbsp; A second pamphlet describing the disaster was issued by the
Council of the Virginia Company in December, and a third by one of the
leaders of the expedition, Sir Thomas Gates.&nbsp; Shakespeare, who
mentions the &lsquo;still vexed Bermoothes&rsquo; (I. i. 229), incorporated
in &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; many hints from Jourdain, Gates, and the other
pamphleteers.&nbsp; The references to the <!-- page 253--><a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>gentle climate of the
island on which Prospero is cast away, and to the spirits and devils that
infested it, seem to render its identification with the newly discovered
Bermudas unquestionable.&nbsp; But Shakespeare incorporated the result of
study of other books of travel.&nbsp; The name of the god Setebos whom
Caliban worships is drawn from Eden&rsquo;s translation of Magellan&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Voyage to the South Pole&rsquo; (in the &lsquo;Historie of
Travell,&rsquo; 1577), where the giants of Patagonia are described as
worshipping a &lsquo;great devil they call Setebos.&rsquo;&nbsp; No source
for the complete plot has been discovered, but the German writer, Jacob
Ayrer, who died in 1605, dramatised a somewhat similar story in &lsquo;Die
sch&ouml;ne Sidea,&rsquo; where the adventures of Prospero, Ferdinand,
Ariel, and Miranda are roughly anticipated. <a name="citation253a"></a><a
href="#footnote253a" class="citation">[253a]</a>&nbsp; English actors were
performing at Nuremberg, where Ayrer lived, in 1604 and 1606, and may have
brought reports of the piece to Shakespeare.&nbsp; Or perhaps both English
and German plays had a common origin in some novel that has not yet been
traced.&nbsp; Gonzalo&rsquo;s description of an ideal commonwealth (II. i.
147 seq.) is derived from Florio&rsquo;s translation of Montaigne&rsquo;s
essays (1603), while into Prospero&rsquo;s great speech renouncing his
practice of magical art (V. i. 33-57) Shakespeare wrought reminiscences of
Golding&rsquo;s translation of Medea&rsquo;s invocation in Ovid&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Metamorphoses&rsquo; (vii. 197-206). <a name="citation253b"></a><a
href="#footnote253b" class="citation">[253b]</a>&nbsp; Golding&rsquo;s
rendering of Ovid had been one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s best-loved books in
youth.</p>
<p><!-- page 254--><a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>A highly ingenious theory, first suggested by Tieck, represents
&lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; (which, excepting the &lsquo;The Comedy of
Errors,&rsquo; is the shortest of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays) as a masque
written to celebrate the marriage of Princess Elizabeth (like Miranda, an
island-princess) with the Elector Frederick.&nbsp; This marriage took place
on February 14, 1612-13, and &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; formed one of a
series of nineteen plays which were performed at the nuptial festivities in
May 1613.&nbsp; But none of the other plays produced seem to have been new;
they were all apparently chosen because they were established favourites at
Court and on the public stage, and neither in subject-matter nor language
bore obviously specific relation to the joyous occasion.&nbsp; But 1613 is,
in fact, on more substantial ground far too late a date to which to assign
the composition of &lsquo;The Tempest.&rsquo;&nbsp; According to
information which was accessible to Malone, the play had &lsquo;a being and
a name&rsquo; in the autumn of 1611, and was no doubt written some months
before. <a name="citation254"></a><a href="#footnote254"
class="citation">[254]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 255--><a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>The plot, which
revolves about the forcible expulsion of a ruler from his dominions, and
his daughter&rsquo;s wooing by the son of the usurper&rsquo;s chief ally,
is, moreover, hardly one that a shrewd playwright would deliberately choose
as the setting of an official epithalamium in honour of the daughter of a
monarch so sensitive about his title to the crown as James I. <a
name="citation255a"></a><a href="#footnote255a"
class="citation">[255a]</a></p>
<p>In the theatre and at court the early representations of &lsquo;The
Tempest&rsquo; evoked unmeasured applause.&nbsp; The success owed something
to the beautiful lyrics which were dispersed through the play and had been
set to music by Robert Johnson, a lutenist in high repute. <a
name="citation255b"></a><a href="#footnote255b"
class="citation">[255b]</a>&nbsp; Like its predecessor &lsquo;A
Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; long maintained its
first popularity in the theatre, and the vogue of the two pieces drew a
passing sneer from Ben Jonson.&nbsp; In the Induction to his
&lsquo;Bartholomew Fair,&rsquo; first acted in 1614, he wrote: &lsquo;If
there be never a servant-monster in the Fair, who can help it he
[<i>i.e.</i> the author] says? nor a nest of Antics.&nbsp; He is loth to
make nature afraid in his plays like those that beget Tales, Tempests, and
such like Drolleries.&rsquo;&nbsp; The &lsquo;servant-monster&rsquo; was an
<!-- page 256--><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>obvious allusion to Caliban, and &lsquo;the nest of Antics&rsquo;
was a glance at the satyrs who figure in the sheepshearing feast in
&lsquo;A Winter&rsquo;s Tale.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Fanciful interpretations of &lsquo;The Tempest.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Nowhere did Shakespeare give rein to his imagination with more imposing
effect than in &lsquo;The Tempest.&rsquo;&nbsp; As in &lsquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream,&rsquo; magical or supernatural agencies are the
mainsprings of the plot.&nbsp; But the tone is marked at all points by a
solemnity and profundity of thought and sentiment which are lacking in the
early comedy.&nbsp; The serious atmosphere has led critics, without much
reason, to detect in the scheme of &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; something more
than the irresponsible play of poetic fancy.&nbsp; Many of the characters
have been represented as the outcome of speculation respecting the least
soluble problems of human existence.&nbsp; Little reliance should be placed
on such interpretations.&nbsp; The creation of Miranda is the apotheosis in
literature of tender, ingenuous girlhood unsophisticated by social
intercourse, but Shakespeare had already sketched the outlines of the
portrait in Marina and Perdita, the youthful heroines respectively of
&lsquo;Pericles&rsquo; and &lsquo;A Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; and these
two characters were directly developed from romantic stories of
girl-princesses, cast by misfortune on the mercies of nature, to which
Shakespeare had recourse for the plots of the two plays.&nbsp; It is by
accident, and not by design, that in Ariel appear to be discernible the
capabilities of human intellect when detached from physical
attributes.&nbsp; Ariel belongs to the same world as Puck, although <!--
page 257--><a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>he is
delineated in the severer colours that were habitual to Shakespeare&rsquo;s
fully developed art.&nbsp; Caliban&mdash;Ariel&rsquo;s antithesis&mdash;did
not owe his existence to any conscious endeavour on Shakespeare&rsquo;s
part to typify human nature before the evolution of moral sentiment. <a
name="citation257a"></a><a href="#footnote257a"
class="citation">[257a]</a>&nbsp; Caliban is an imaginary portrait,
conceived with matchless vigour and vividness, of the aboriginal savage of
the New World, descriptions of whom abounded in contemporary
travellers&rsquo; speech and writings, and universally excited the
liveliest curiosity. <a name="citation257b"></a><a href="#footnote257b"
class="citation">[257b]</a>&nbsp; In Prospero, the guiding providence of
the romance, who resigns his magic power in the closing scene, traces have
been sought of the lineaments of the dramatist himself, who in this play
probably bade farewell to the enchanted work of his life.&nbsp; Prospero is
in the story a scholar-prince of rare intellectual attainments, whose
engrossing study of the mysteries of science has given him command of the
forces of nature.&nbsp; His magnanimous renunciation of his magical faculty
as soon as by its exercise he has restored his shattered fortunes is in
perfect accord with the general conception of his just and philosophical
temper.&nbsp; Any other justification of his final act is superfluous.</p>
<h3>Unfinished plays.&nbsp; The lost play of &lsquo;Cardenio.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>While there is every indication that in 1611 Shakespeare abandoned
dramatic composition, there seems <!-- page 258--><a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>little doubt that he
left with the manager of his company unfinished drafts of more than one
play which others were summoned at a later date to complete.&nbsp; His
place at the head of the active dramatists was at once filled by John
Fletcher, and Fletcher, with some aid possibly from his friend Philip
Massinger, undertook the working up of Shakespeare&rsquo;s unfinished
sketches.&nbsp; On September 9, 1653, the publisher Humphrey Moseley
obtained a license for the publication of a play which he described as
&lsquo;History of Cardenio, by Fletcher and Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
was probably identical with the lost play, &lsquo;Cardenno,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Cardenna,&rsquo; which was twice acted at Court by
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company in 1613&mdash;in May during the Princess
Elizabeth&rsquo;s marriage festivities, and on June 8 before the Duke of
Savoy&rsquo;s ambassador. <a name="citation258a"></a><a
href="#footnote258a" class="citation">[258a]</a>&nbsp; Moseley, whose
description may have been fraudulent, <a name="citation258b"></a><a
href="#footnote258b" class="citation">[258b]</a> failed to publish the
piece, and nothing is otherwise known of it with certainty; but it was no
doubt a dramatic version of the adventures of the lovelorn Cardenio which
are related in the first part of &lsquo;Don Quixote&rsquo; (ch.
xxiii.-xxxvii.)&nbsp; Cervantes&rsquo;s amorous story, which first appeared
in English in Thomas Shelton&rsquo;s translation in 1612, offers much
incident in Fletcher&rsquo;s vein.&nbsp; When Lewis Theobald, <!-- page
259--><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>the
Shakespearean critic, brought out his &lsquo;Double Falshood, or the
Distrest Lovers,&rsquo; in 1727, he mysteriously represented that the play
was based on an unfinished and unpublished draft of a play by
Shakespeare.&nbsp; The story of Theobald&rsquo;s piece is the story of
Cardenio, although the characters are renamed.&nbsp; There is nothing in
the play as published by Theobald to suggest Shakespeare&rsquo;s hand, <a
name="citation259a"></a><a href="#footnote259a" class="citation">[259a]</a>
but Theobald doubtless took advantage of a tradition that Shakespeare and
Fletcher had combined to dramatise the Cervantic theme.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Two Noble Kinsmen.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>Two other pieces, &lsquo;The Two Noble Kinsmen&rsquo; and &lsquo;Henry
VIII,&rsquo; which are attributed to a similar partnership, survive. <a
name="citation259b"></a><a href="#footnote259b"
class="citation">[259b]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;The Two Noble Kinsmen&rsquo; was
first printed in 1634, and was written, according to the title-page,
&lsquo;by the memorable worthies of their time, Mr. John Fletcher and Mr.
William Shakespeare, gentlemen.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was included in the folio
of Beaumont and Fletcher of 1679.&nbsp; On grounds alike of &aelig;sthetic
criticism and metrical tests, a substantial portion of the play was
assigned to Shakespeare by Charles Lamb, Coleridge, and Dyce.&nbsp; The
last included it in his edition of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Coleridge detected
Shakespeare&rsquo;s hand in act I., act II. sc. i., and act III. sc. i. and
ii.&nbsp; In addition to <!-- page 260--><a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>those scenes, act IV. sc. iii. and act V.
(except sc. ii.) were subsequently placed to his credit.&nbsp; Some recent
critics assign much of the alleged Shakespearean work to Massinger, and
they narrow Shakespeare&rsquo;s contribution to the first scene (with the
opening song, &lsquo;Roses their sharp spines being gone&rsquo;) and act V.
sc. i. and iv. <a name="citation260"></a><a href="#footnote260"
class="citation">[260]</a>&nbsp; An exact partition is impossible, but
frequent signs of Shakespeare&rsquo;s workmanship are unmistakable.&nbsp;
All the passages for which Shakespeare can on any showing be held
responsible develop the main plot, which is drawn from Chaucer&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Knight&rsquo;s Tale&rsquo; of Palamon and Arcite, and seems to have
been twice dramatised previously.&nbsp; A lost play, &lsquo;Pal&aelig;mon
and Arcyte,&rsquo; by Richard Edwardes, was acted at Court in 1566, and a
second piece, called &lsquo;Palamon and Arsett&rsquo; (also lost), was
purchased by Henslowe in 1594.&nbsp; The non-Shakespearean residue of
&lsquo;The Two Noble Kinsmen&rsquo; is disfigured by indecency and
triviality, and is of no literary value.</p>
<h3>&lsquo;Henry VIII.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>A like problem is presented by &lsquo;Henry VIII.&rsquo;&nbsp; The play
was nearly associated with the final scene in the history of that theatre
which was identified with the triumphs of Shakespeare&rsquo;s career.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Henry VIII&rsquo; was in course of performance at the Globe Theatre
on June 29, 1613, when the firing of some cannon incidental to the
performance set fire to the playhouse, which was burned down.&nbsp; The
theatre was rebuilt next year, but the <!-- page 261--><a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>new fabric never
acquired the fame of the old.&nbsp; Sir Henry Wotton, describing the
disaster on July 2, entitled the piece that was in process of
representation at the time as &lsquo;All is True representing some
principal pieces in the Reign of Henry VIII.&rsquo; <a
name="citation261"></a><a href="#footnote261"
class="citation">[261]</a>&nbsp; The play of &lsquo;Henry VIII&rsquo; that
is commonly allotted to Shakespeare is loosely constructed, and the last
act ill <!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>coheres with its predecessors.&nbsp; The whole resembles an
&lsquo;historical masque.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was first printed in the folio of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s works in 1623, but shows traces of more hands than
one.&nbsp; The three chief characters&mdash;the king, Queen Katharine of
Arragon, and Cardinal Wolsey&mdash;bear clear marks of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
best workmanship; but only act i. sc. i., act ii. sc. iii. and iv.
(Katharine&rsquo;s trial), act iii. sc. ii. (except ll. 204-460), act v.
sc. i. can on either &aelig;sthetic or metrical grounds be confidently
assigned to him.&nbsp; These portions may, according to their metrical
characteristics, be dated, like the &lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo;
about 1611.&nbsp; There are good grounds for assigning nearly all the
remaining thirteen scenes to the pen of Fletcher, with occasional aid from
Massinger.&nbsp; Wolsey&rsquo;s familiar farewell to Cromwell (III. ii.
204-460) is the only passage the authorship of which excites really grave
embarrassment.&nbsp; It recalls at every point the style of Fletcher, and
nowhere that of Shakespeare.&nbsp; But the Fletcherian style, as it is here
displayed, is invested with a greatness that is not matched elsewhere in
Fletcher&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; That Fletcher should have exhibited such
faculty once and once only is barely credible, and we are driven to the
alternative conclusion that the noble valediction was by Shakespeare, who
in it gave proof of his versatility by echoing in a glorified key the
habitual strain of Fletcher, his colleague and virtual successor.&nbsp;
James Spedding&rsquo;s theory that Fletcher hastily completed
Shakespeare&rsquo;s unfinished draft for the special purpose of enabling
the company to celebrate the marriage of Princess Elizabeth and the Elector
Palatine, which <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>took place on February 14, 1612-13, seems
fanciful.&nbsp; During May 1613, according to an extant list, nineteen
plays were produced at Court in honour of the event, but &lsquo;Henry
VIII&rsquo; is not among them. <a name="citation263a"></a><a
href="#footnote263a" class="citation">[263a]</a>&nbsp; The conjecture that
Massinger and Fletcher alone collaborated in &lsquo;Henry VIII&rsquo; (to
the exclusion of Shakespeare altogether) does not deserve serious
consideration. <a name="citation263b"></a><a href="#footnote263b"
class="citation">[263b]</a></p>
<h2><!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>XVI&mdash;THE CLOSE OF LIFE</h2>
<h3>Plays at Court in 1613.&nbsp; Actor-friends.</h3>
<p>The concluding years of Shakespeare&rsquo;s life (1611-1616) were mainly
passed at Stratford.&nbsp; It is probable that in 1611 he disposed of his
shares in the Globe and Blackfriars theatres.&nbsp; He owned none at the
date of his death.&nbsp; But until 1614 he paid frequent visits to London,
where friends in sympathy with his work were alone to be found.&nbsp; His
plays continued to form the staple of Court performances.&nbsp; In May
1613, during the Princess Elizabeth&rsquo;s marriage festivities, Heming,
Shakespeare&rsquo;s former colleague, produced at Whitehall no fewer than
seven of his plays, viz. &lsquo;Much Ado,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tempest,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir John Falstaff&rsquo;
(<i>i.e.</i> &lsquo;Merry Wives&rsquo;), &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; &lsquo;and Hotspur&rsquo; (doubtless
&lsquo;Henry IV&rsquo;). <a name="citation264"></a><a href="#footnote264"
class="citation">[264]</a>&nbsp; Of his actor-friends, one of the chief,
Augustine Phillips, had died in 1605, leaving by will &lsquo;to my fellowe,
William Shakespeare, a thirty-shillings piece of gold.&rsquo;&nbsp; With
Burbage, Heming, and Condell his relations remained close to the end.&nbsp;
Burbage, according to a poetic elegy, made his reputation by creating the
leading parts in Shakespeare&rsquo;s greatest tragedies.&nbsp; Hamlet, <!--
page 265--><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>Othello, and Lear were r&ocirc;les in which he gained especial
renown.&nbsp; But Burbage and Shakespeare were popularly credited with
co-operation in less solemn enterprises.&nbsp; They were reputed to be
companions in many sportive adventures.&nbsp; The sole anecdote of
Shakespeare that is positively known to have been recorded in his lifetime
relates that Burbage, when playing Richard III, agreed with a lady in the
audience to visit her after the performance; Shakespeare, overhearing the
conversation, anticipated the actor&rsquo;s visit, and met Burbage on his
arrival with the quip that &lsquo;William the Conqueror was before Richard
the Third.&rsquo; <a name="citation265a"></a><a href="#footnote265a"
class="citation">[265a]</a></p>
<p>Such gossip possibly deserves little more acceptance than the later
story, in the same key, which credits Shakespeare with the paternity of Sir
William D&rsquo;Avenant.&nbsp; The latter was baptised at Oxford on March
3, 1605, as the son of John D&rsquo;Avenant, the landlord of the Crown Inn,
where Shakespeare lodged in his journeys to and from Stratford.&nbsp; The
story of Shakespeare&rsquo;s parental relation to D&rsquo;Avenant was long
current in Oxford, and was at times complacently accepted by the reputed
son.&nbsp; Shakespeare is known to have been a welcome guest at John
D&rsquo;Avenant&rsquo;s house, and another son, Robert, boasted of the
kindly notice which the poet took of him as a child. <a
name="citation265b"></a><a href="#footnote265b"
class="citation">[265b]</a>&nbsp; It is safer to adopt the less
compromising version which makes Shakespeare the <!-- page 266--><a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>godfather of the boy
William instead of his father.&nbsp; But the antiquity and persistence of
the scandal belie the assumption that Shakespeare was known to his
contemporaries as a man of scrupulous virtue.&nbsp; Ben Jonson and
Drayton&mdash;the latter a Warwickshire man&mdash;seem to have been
Shakespeare&rsquo;s closest literary friends in his latest years.</p>
<h3>Final settlement at Stratford.</h3>
<p>At Stratford, in the words of Nicholas Rowe, &lsquo;the latter part of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s life was spent, as all men of good sense will wish
theirs may be, in ease, retirement, and the conversation of his
friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; As a resident in the town, he took a full share of
social and civic responsibilities.&nbsp; On October 16, 1608, he stood
chief godfather to William, son of Henry Walker, a mercer and
alderman.&nbsp; On September 11, 1611, when he had finally settled in New
Place, his name appeared in the margin of a folio page of donors (including
all the principal inhabitants of Stratford) to a fund that was raised
&lsquo;towards the charge of prosecuting the bill in Parliament for the
better repair of the highways.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Domestic affairs.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile his own domestic affairs engaged some of his attention.&nbsp;
Of his two surviving children&mdash;both daughters&mdash;the eldest,
Susanna, had married, on June 5, 1607, John Hall (1575-1635), a rising
physician of Puritan leanings, and in the following February there was born
the poet&rsquo;s only granddaughter, Elizabeth Hall.&nbsp; On September 9,
1608, the poet&rsquo;s mother was buried in the parish church, and on
February 4, 1613, his third brother Richard.&nbsp; On July 15, 1613, Mrs.
Hall preferred, <!-- page 267--><a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>with her father&rsquo;s assistance, a charge
of slander against one Lane in the ecclesiastical court at Worcester; the
defendant, who had apparently charged the lady with illicit relations with
one Ralph Smith, did not appear, and was excommunicated.</p>

</a></p>
<h3>Purchase of a house in Blackfriars.</h3>
<p>In the same year (1613), when on a short visit to London, Shakespeare
invested a small sum of money in a new property.&nbsp; This was his last
investment in real estate.&nbsp; He then purchased a house, the
ground-floor of which was a haberdasher&rsquo;s shop, with a yard
attached.&nbsp; It was situated within six hundred feet of the Blackfriars
Theatre&mdash;on the west side of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hill, formerly termed
Puddle Hill or Puddle Dock Hill, in the near neighbourhood of what is now
known as Ireland Yard.&nbsp; The former owner, Henry Walker, a musician,
had bought the property for &pound;100 in 1604.&nbsp; Shakespeare in 1613
agreed to pay him &pound;140.&nbsp; The deeds of conveyance bear the date
of March 10 in that year. <a name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"
class="citation">[267]</a>&nbsp; Next day, on March 11, Shakespeare
executed another deed (now in the British Museum) which stipulated that
&pound;60 of the purchase-money was to remain on mortgage until the
following Michaelmas.&nbsp; The money was unpaid at Shakespeare&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; In both purchase-deed and mortgage-deed Shakespeare&rsquo;s
signature was witnessed by (among others) Henry Lawrence,
&lsquo;servant&rsquo; or clerk to Robert Andrewes, the scrivener who drew
<!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>the deeds, and Lawrence&rsquo;s seal, bearing his initials
&lsquo;H. L.,&rsquo; was stamped in each case on the parchment-tag, across
the head of which Shakespeare wrote his name.&nbsp; In all three
documents&mdash;the two indentures and the mortgage-deed&mdash;Shakespeare
is described as &lsquo;of Stratford-on-Avon, in the Countie of Warwick,
Gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no reason to suppose that he acquired the
house for his own residence.&nbsp; He at once leased the property to John
Robinson, already a resident in the neighbourhood.</p>

<h3>Attempt to enclose the Stratford common fields.</h3>
<p>With puritans and puritanism Shakespeare was not in sympathy, <a
name="citation268"></a><a href="#footnote268" class="citation">[268]</a>
and he could hardly have viewed with unvarying composure the steady
progress that puritanism was making among his fellow-townsmen.&nbsp;
Nevertheless a preacher, doubtless of puritan proclivities, was entertained
at Shakespeare&rsquo;s residence, New Place, after delivering a sermon in
the spring of 1614.&nbsp; The incident might serve to illustrate
Shakespeare&rsquo;s characteristic placability, but his son-in-law Hall,
who avowed sympathy with puritanism, was <!-- page 269--><a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>probably in the main
responsible for the civility. <a name="citation269a"></a><a
href="#footnote269a" class="citation">[269a]</a>&nbsp; In July John Combe,
a rich inhabitant of Stratford, died and left &pound;5 to
Shakespeare.&nbsp; The legend that Shakespeare alienated him by composing
some doggerel on his practice of lending money at ten or twelve per cent.
seems apocryphal, although it is quoted by Aubrey and accepted by Rowe. <a
name="citation269b"></a><a href="#footnote269b"
class="citation">[269b]</a>&nbsp; Combe&rsquo;s death involved Shakespeare
more conspicuously than before in civic affairs.&nbsp; Combe&rsquo;s heir
William no sooner succeeded to his father&rsquo;s lands than he, with a
neighbouring owner, Arthur Mannering, steward of Lord-chancellor Ellesmere
(who was ex-officio lord of the manor), attempted <!-- page 270--><a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>to enclose the common
fields, which belonged to the corporation of Stratford, about his estate at
Welcombe.&nbsp; The corporation resolved to offer the scheme a stout
resistance.&nbsp; Shakespeare had a twofold interest in the matter by
virtue of his owning the freehold of 106 acres at Welcombe and Old
Stratford, and as joint owner&mdash;now with Thomas Greene, the town
clerk&mdash;of the tithes of Old Stratford, Welcombe, and Bishopton.&nbsp;
His interest in his freeholds could not have been prejudicially affected,
but his interest in the tithes might be depreciated by the proposed
enclosure.&nbsp; Shakespeare consequently joined with his fellow-owner
Greene in obtaining from Combe&rsquo;s agent Replingham in October 1614 a
deed indemnifying both against any injury they might suffer from the
enclosure.&nbsp; But having thus secured himself against all possible loss,
Shakespeare threw his influence into Combe&rsquo;s scale.&nbsp; In November
1614 he was on a last visit to London, and Greene, whose official position
as town clerk compelled him to support the corporation in defiance of his
private interests, visited him there to discuss the position of
affairs.&nbsp; On December 23, 1614, the corporation in formal meeting drew
up a letter to Shakespeare imploring him to aid them.&nbsp; Greene himself
sent to the dramatist &lsquo;a note of inconveniences [to the corporation
that] would happen by the enclosure.&rsquo;&nbsp; But although an ambiguous
entry of a later date (September 1615) in the few extant pages of
Greene&rsquo;s ungrammatical diary has been unjustifiably tortured into an
expression of disgust on Shakespeare&rsquo;s part <!-- page 271--><a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>at Combe&rsquo;s
conduct, <a name="citation271"></a><a href="#footnote271"
class="citation">[271]</a> it is plain that, in the spirit of his agreement
with Combe&rsquo;s agent, he continued to lend Combe his countenance.&nbsp;
Happily Combe&rsquo;s efforts failed, and the common lands remain
unenclosed.</p>
<h3>Death.&nbsp; Burial.</h3>
<p>At the beginning of 1616 Shakespeare&rsquo;s health was failing.&nbsp;
He directed Francis Collins, a solicitor of Warwick, to draft his will,
but, though it was prepared for signature on January 25, it was for the
time laid aside.&nbsp; On February 10, 1616, Shakespeare&rsquo;s younger
daughter, Judith, married, at Stratford parish church, Thomas Quincy, four
years her junior, a son of an old friend of the poet.&nbsp; The ceremony
took place apparently without public asking of the banns and before a
license was procured.&nbsp; The irregularity led to the summons of the
bride and bridegroom to the ecclesiastical court at Worcester and the
imposition of a fine.&nbsp; According to the testimony of John Ward, the
vicar, Shakespeare entertained at New Place his two friends, Michael
Drayton and Ben Jonson, in this same spring of 1616, and &lsquo;had a <!--
page 272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>merry
meeting,&rsquo; but &lsquo;itt seems drank too hard, for Shakespeare died
of a feavour there contracted.&rsquo;&nbsp; A popular local legend, which
was not recorded till 1762, <a name="citation272a"></a><a
href="#footnote272a" class="citation">[272a]</a> credited Shakespeare with
engaging at an earlier date in a prolonged and violent drinking bout at
Bidford, a neighbouring village, <a name="citation272b"></a><a
href="#footnote272b" class="citation">[272b]</a> but his achievements as a
hard drinker may be dismissed as unproven.&nbsp; The cause of his death is
undetermined, but probably his illness seemed likely to take a fatal turn
in March, when he revised and signed the will that had been drafted in the
previous January.&nbsp; On Tuesday, April 23, he died at the age of
fifty-two. <a name="citation272c"></a><a href="#footnote272c"
class="citation">[272c]</a>&nbsp; On Thursday, April 25 (O.S.), the poet
was buried inside Stratford Church, near the northern wall of the chancel,
in which, as part-owner of the tithes, and consequently one of the
lay-rectors, he had a right of interment.&nbsp; Hard by was the
charnel-house, where bones dug up from the churchyard were deposited.&nbsp;
Over the poet&rsquo;s grave were inscribed the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good friend, for Jesus&rsquo; sake forbeare<br />
To dig the dust enclosed heare;<br />
Bleste be the man that spares these stones,<br />
And curst be he that moves my bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to one William Hall, who described a <!-- page 273--><a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>visit to Stratford in
1694, <a name="citation273"></a><a href="#footnote273"
class="citation">[273]</a> these verses were penned by Shakespeare to suit
&lsquo;the capacity of clerks and sextons, for the most part a very
ignorant set of people.&rsquo;&nbsp; Had this curse not threatened them,
Hall proceeds, the sexton would not have hesitated in course of time to
remove Shakespeare&rsquo;s dust to &lsquo;the bone-house.&rsquo;&nbsp; As
it was, the grave was made seventeen feet deep, and was never opened, even
to receive his wife, although she expressed a desire to be buried with her
husband.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p273.jpg">
<img alt="Signatures from each sheet of the will" src="images/p273.jpg" />
</a></p>
<h3>The will.&nbsp; Bequest to his wife.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s will, the first draft of which was drawn up before
January 25, 1616, received many interlineations and erasures before it was
signed in the ensuing March.&nbsp; Francis Collins, the solicitor of
Warwick, and Thomas Russell, &lsquo;esquier,&rsquo; of Stratford, were the
overseers; it was proved by John Hall, the poet&rsquo;s son-in-law and
joint-executor with Mrs. Hall, in London on June 22 following.&nbsp; The
religious exordium is in conventional phraseology, and gives no clue to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s personal religious opinions.&nbsp; What those opinions
were, we have neither the means nor the warrant for discussing.&nbsp; But
while it is possible to quote from the plays many contemptuous references
to the puritans and their doctrines, we may dismiss as idle gossip
Davies&rsquo;s irresponsible report that &lsquo;he dyed a
papist.&rsquo;&nbsp; The name of Shakespeare&rsquo;s wife was omitted from
the original draft of the will, but by an interlineation in the final draft
she received his second best bed <!-- page 274--><a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>with its
furniture.&nbsp; No other bequest was made her.&nbsp; Several wills of the
period have been discovered in which a bedstead or other article of
household furniture formed part of a wife&rsquo;s inheritance, but none
except Shakespeare&rsquo;s is forthcoming in which a bed forms the sole
bequest.&nbsp; At the same time the precision with which
Shakespeare&rsquo;s will accounts for and assigns to other legatees every
known item of his property refutes the conjecture that he had set aside any
portion of it under a previous settlement or jointure with a view to making
independent provision for his wife.&nbsp; Her right to a widow&rsquo;s
dower&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to a third share for life in freehold
estate&mdash;was not subject to testamentary disposition, but Shakespeare
had taken steps to prevent her from benefiting&mdash;at any rate to the
full extent&mdash;by that legal arrangement.&nbsp; He had barred her dower
in the case of his latest purchase of freehold estate, viz. the house at
Blackfriars. <a name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274"
class="citation">[274]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 275--><a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>Such procedure is
pretty conclusive proof that he had the intention of excluding her from the
enjoyment of his possessions after his death.&nbsp; But, however plausible
the theory that his relations with her were from first to last wanting in
sympathy, it is improbable that either the slender mention of her in the
will or the barring of her dower was designed by Shakespeare to make public
his indifference or dislike.&nbsp; Local tradition subsequently credited
her with a wish to be buried in his grave; and her epitaph proves that she
inspired her daughters with genuine affection.&nbsp; Probably her ignorance
of affairs and the infirmities of age (she was past sixty) combined to
unfit her in the poet&rsquo;s eyes for the control of property, and, as an
act of ordinary prudence, he committed her to the care of his elder
daughter, who inherited, according to such information as is accessible,
some of his own shrewdness, and had a capable adviser in her husband.</p>
<h3>His heiress.&nbsp; Legacies to friends.</h3>
<p>This elder daughter, Susanna Hall, was, according to the will, to become
mistress of New Place, and practically of all the poet&rsquo;s
estate.&nbsp; She received (with remainder to her issue in strict entail)
New Place, all the land, barns, and gardens at and near Stratford (except
the tenement in Chapel Lane), and the house in Blackfriars, London, while
she and her husband were appointed executors and residuary legatees, with
full rights over nearly all the poet&rsquo;s household furniture and
personal belongings.&nbsp; To their only child and the testator&rsquo;s
granddaughter, or &lsquo;niece,&rsquo; Elizabeth Hall, was bequeathed <!--
page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>the
poet&rsquo;s plate, with the exception of his broad silver and gilt bowl,
which was reserved for his younger daughter, Judith.&nbsp; To his younger
daughter he also left, with the tenement in Chapel Lane (in remainder to
the elder daughter), &pound;150 in money, of which &pound;100, her marriage
portion, was to be paid within a year, and another &pound;150 to be paid to
her if alive three years after the date of the will. <a
name="citation276a"></a><a href="#footnote276a"
class="citation">[276a]</a>&nbsp; To the poet&rsquo;s sister, Joan Hart,
whose husband, William Hart, predeceased the testator by only six days, he
left, besides a contingent reversionary interest in Judith&rsquo;s
pecuniary legacy, his wearing apparel, &pound;20 in money, a life interest
in the Henley Street property, with &pound;5 for each of her three sons,
William, Thomas, and Michael.&nbsp; To the poor of Stratford he gave
&pound;10, and to Mr. Thomas Combe (apparently a brother of William, of the
enclosure controversy) his sword.&nbsp; To each of his Stratford friends,
Hamlett Sadler, William Reynoldes, Anthony Nash, and John Nash, and to each
of his &lsquo;fellows&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> theatrical colleagues in London),
John Heming, Richard Burbage, and Henry Condell, he left xxvj<i>s</i>.
viij<i>d</i>., with which to buy memorial rings.&nbsp; His godson, William
Walker, received &lsquo;xx&rsquo; shillings in gold.</p>
<h3>The tomb.</h3>
<p>Before 1623 <a name="citation276b"></a><a href="#footnote276b"
class="citation">[276b]</a> an elaborate monument, by a London sculptor of
Dutch birth, Gerard Johnson, was erected <!-- page 277--><a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s memory in the chancel of the parish church. <a
name="citation277"></a><a href="#footnote277"
class="citation">[277]</a>&nbsp; It includes a half-length bust, depicting
the dramatist on the point of writing.&nbsp; The fingers of the right hand
are disposed as if holding a pen, and under the left hand lies a quarto
sheet of paper.&nbsp; The inscription, which was apparently by a London
friend, runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judicio Pylium, genio Socratem, arte Maronem,<br />
Terra tegit, populus m&aelig;ret, Olympus habet.</p>
<p>Stay passenger, why goest thou by so fast?<br />

</blockquote>
<h3>Personal character.</h3>
<p>At the opening of Shakespeare&rsquo;s career Chettle wrote of his
&lsquo;civil demeanour&rsquo; and of the reports of &lsquo;his uprightness
of dealing which argues his honesty.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1601&mdash;when near
the zenith of his fame&mdash;he was apostrophised as &lsquo;sweet Master
Shakespeare&rsquo; in the play of &lsquo;The Return from Parnassus,&rsquo;
and that adjective was long after associated with his name.&nbsp; In 1604
one Anthony Scoloker in a poem called &lsquo;Daiphantus&rsquo; bestowed on
him the epithet &lsquo;friendly.&rsquo;&nbsp; After the close of his career
Jonson wrote of him: &lsquo;I loved the man and do honour his memory, on
this side idolatry as much as any.&nbsp; He was, indeed, honest and of an
open and free <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>nature.&rsquo; <a name="citation278a"></a><a
href="#footnote278a" class="citation">[278a]</a>&nbsp; No other
contemporary left on record any definite impression of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
personal character, and the &lsquo;Sonnets,&rsquo; which alone of his
literary work can be held to throw any illumination on a personal trait,
mainly reveal him in the light of one who was willing to conform to all the
conventional methods in vogue for strengthening the bonds between a poet
and a great patron.&nbsp; His literary practices and aims were those of
contemporary men of letters, and the difference in the quality of his work
and theirs was due not to conscious endeavour on his part to act otherwise
than they, but to the magic and involuntary working of his genius.&nbsp; He
seemed unconscious of his marvellous superiority to his professional
comrades.&nbsp; The references in his will to his fellow-actors, and the
spirit in which (as they announce in the First Folio) they approached the
task of collecting his works after his death, corroborate the description
of him as a sympathetic friend of gentle, unassuming mien.&nbsp; The later
traditions brought together by Aubrey depict him as &lsquo;very good
company, and of a very ready and pleasant smooth wit,&rsquo; and there is
much in other early posthumous references to suggest a genial, if not a
convivial, temperament, linked to a quiet turn for good-humoured
satire.&nbsp; But Bohemian ideals and modes of life had no genuine
attraction for Shakespeare.&nbsp; His extant work attests his
&lsquo;copious&rsquo; and continuous industry, <a
name="citation278b"></a><a href="#footnote278b" class="citation">[278b]</a>
and with his literary power and <!-- page 279--><a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>sociability there clearly went the shrewd
capacity of a man of business.&nbsp; Pope had just warrant for the surmise
that he</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For gain not glory winged his roving flight,<br />
And grew immortal in his own despite.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His literary attainments and successes were chiefly valued as serving
the prosaic end of providing permanently for himself and his
daughters.&nbsp; His highest ambition was to restore among his
fellow-townsmen the family repute which his father&rsquo;s misfortunes had
imperilled.&nbsp; Ideals so homely are reckoned rare among poets, but
Chaucer and Sir Walter Scott, among writers of exalted genius, vie with
Shakespeare in the sobriety of their personal aims and in the sanity of
their mental attitude towards life&rsquo;s ordinary incidents.</p>

280</span>XVII&mdash;SURVIVORS AND DESCENDANTS</h2>
<h3>The survivors.&nbsp; Mistress Judith Quiney.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s widow died on August 6, 1623, at the age of
sixty-seven, and was buried near her husband inside the chancel two days
later.&nbsp; Some affectionately phrased Latin elegiacs&mdash;doubtless
from Dr. Hall&rsquo;s pen&mdash;were inscribed on a brass plate fastened to
the stone above her grave. <a name="citation280"></a><a href="#footnote280"
class="citation">[280]</a>&nbsp; The younger daughter, Judith, resided with
her husband, Thomas Quiney, at The Cage, a house which he leased in Bridge
Street from 1616 till 1652.&nbsp; There he carried on the trade of a
vintner, and took part in municipal affairs, acting as a councillor from
1617 and as chamberlain in 1621-2 and 1622-3; but after 1630 his affairs
grew embarrassed, and he left Stratford late in 1652 for London, where he
seems to have died a few months later.&nbsp; Of his three sons by Judith,
the eldest, Shakespeare (baptised on November 23, 1616), was buried in
Stratford Churchyard on May 8, 1617; the second son, <!-- page 281--><a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>Richard (baptised on
February 9, 1617-18), was buried on January 28, 1638-9; and the third son,
Thomas (baptised on January 23, 1619-20), was buried on February 26,
1638-9.&nbsp; Judith survived her husband, sons, and sister, dying at
Stratford on February 9, 1661-2, in her seventy-seventh year.</p>
<h3>Mistress Susannah Hall.</h3>
<p>The poet&rsquo;s elder daughter, Mrs. Susanna Hall, resided at New Place
till her death.&nbsp; Her sister Judith alienated to her the Chapel Place
tenement before 1633, but that, with the interest in the Stratford tithes,
she soon disposed of.&nbsp; Her husband, Dr. John Hall, died on November
25, 1635.&nbsp; In 1642 James Cooke, a surgeon in attendance on some
Royalist troops stationed at Stratford, visited Mrs. Hall and examined
manuscripts in her possession, but they were apparently of her
husband&rsquo;s, not of her father&rsquo;s, composition. <a
name="citation281"></a><a href="#footnote281"
class="citation">[281]</a>&nbsp; From July 11 to 13, 1643, Queen Henrietta
Maria, while journeying from Newark to Oxford, was billeted on Mrs. Hall at
New Place for three days, and was visited there by Prince Rupert.&nbsp;
Mrs. Hall was buried beside her husband in Stratford Churchyard on July 11,
1649, and a rhyming inscription, describing her as &lsquo;witty above her
sex,&rsquo; was engraved on her tombstone.&nbsp; The whole inscription ran:
&lsquo;Heere lyeth ye body of Svsanna, wife to John Hall, Gent. ye davghter
of William Shakespeare, Gent.&nbsp; She deceased ye 11th of Jvly, A.D.
1649, aged 66.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  &lsquo;Witty above her sexe, but that&rsquo;s not all,<br />
Wise to Salvation was good Mistress Hall,<br />
<!-- page 282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>Something of Shakespere was in that, but this<br />
Wholy of him with whom she&rsquo;s now in blisse.<br />
Then, passenger, ha&rsquo;st ne&rsquo;re a teare,<br />
&nbsp;  To weepe with her that wept with all?<br />
That wept, yet set herselfe to chere<br />
&nbsp;  Them up with comforts cordiall.<br />
Her Love shall live, her mercy spread,<br />
When thou hast ne&rsquo;re a teare to shed.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The last descendant.</h3>
<p>Mrs. Hall&rsquo;s only child, Elizabeth, was the last surviving
descendant of the poet.&nbsp; In April 1626 she married her first husband,
Thomas Nash of Stratford (<i>b.</i> 1593), who studied at Lincoln&rsquo;s
Inn, was a man of property, and, dying childless at New Place on April 4,
1647, was buried in Stratford Church next day.&nbsp; At Billesley, a
village four miles from Stratford, on June 5, 1649, Mrs. Nash married, as a
second husband, a widower, John Bernard or Barnard of Abington,
Northamptonshire, who was knighted by Charles II in 1661.&nbsp; About the
same date she seems to have abandoned New Place for her husband&rsquo;s
residence at Abington.&nbsp; Dying without issue, she was buried there on
February 17, 1669-70.&nbsp; Her husband survived her four years, and was
buried beside her. <a name="citation282"></a><a href="#footnote282"
class="citation">[282]</a>&nbsp; On her mother&rsquo;s death in 1649 Lady
Barnard inherited under the poet&rsquo;s will the land near Stratford, New
Place, the house at Blackfriars, and (on the death of the poet&rsquo;s
sister, Joan Hart, in 1646) the houses in Henley Street, while her father,
Dr. Hall, left her in 1635 a house at Acton with a meadow.&nbsp; She sold
the Blackfriars house, and apparently the Stratford land, before
1667.&nbsp; By her will, dated January <!-- page 283--><a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>1669-70, and proved
in the following March, she left small bequests to the daughters of Thomas
Hathaway, of the family of her grandmother, the poet&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp;
The houses in Henley Street passed to her cousin, Thomas Hart, the grandson
of the poet&rsquo;s sister Joan, and they remained in the possession of
Thomas&rsquo;s direct descendants till 1806 (the male line expired on the
death of John Hart in 1800).&nbsp; By her will Lady Barnard also ordered
New Place to be sold, and it was purchased on May 18, 1675, by Sir Edward
Walker, through whose daughter Barbara, wife of Sir John Clopton, it
reverted to the Clopton family.&nbsp; Sir John rebuilt it in 1702.&nbsp; On
the death of his son Hugh in 1752, it was bought by the Rev. Francis
Gastrell (<i>d.</i> 1768), who demolished the new building in 1759. <a

class="citation">[283]</a></p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s brothers.</h3>
<p>Of Shakespeare&rsquo;s three brothers, only one, Gilbert, seems to have
survived him.&nbsp; Edmund, the youngest brother, &lsquo;a player,&rsquo;
was buried at St. Saviour&rsquo;s Church, Southwark, &lsquo;with a
fore-noone knell of the great bell,&rsquo; on December 31, 1607; he was in
his twenty-eighth year.&nbsp; Richard, John Shakespeare&rsquo;s third son,
died at Stratford in February 1613, aged 29.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gilbert
Shakespeare adolescens,&rsquo; who was buried at Stratford on February 3,
1611-12, was doubtless son of the poet&rsquo;s next brother, Gilbert; the
latter, having nearly completed his forty-sixth year, could scarcely be
described as &lsquo;adolescens;&rsquo; his death is not recorded, but
according to Oldys he survived to a patriarchal age.</p>

284</span>XVIII&mdash;AUTOGRAPHS, PORTRAITS, AND MEMORIALS</h2>
<h3>Spelling of the poet&rsquo;s surname.&nbsp; Autograph signatures.</h3>
<p>Much controversy has arisen over the spelling of the poet&rsquo;s
surname.&nbsp; It has been proved capable of four thousand variations. <a
name="citation284"></a><a href="#footnote284"
class="citation">[284]</a>&nbsp; The name of the poet&rsquo;s father is
entered sixty-six times in the council books of Stratford, and is spelt in
sixteen ways.&nbsp; The commonest form is &lsquo;Shaxpeare.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Five autographs of the poet of undisputed authenticity are extant: his
signature to the indenture relating to the purchase of the property in
Blackfriars, dated March 10, 1612-13 (since 1841 in the Guildhall Library);
his signature to the mortgage-deed relating to the same purchase, dated
March 11, 1612-13 (since 1858 in the British Museum), and the three
signatures on the three sheets of his will, dated March 25, 1615-16 (now at
Somerset House).&nbsp; In all the signatures some of the letters are
represented by recognised signs of abbreviation.&nbsp; The signature to the
first document is &lsquo;William Shakspere,&rsquo; though in all other
portions of the deed the name is spelt &lsquo;Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
signature to the second <!-- page 285--><a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>document has been interpreted both as
Shakspere and Shakspeare.&nbsp; The ink of the first signature in the will
has now faded almost beyond decipherment, but that it was
&lsquo;Shakspere&rsquo; may be inferred from the facsimile made by Steevens
in 1776.&nbsp; The second and third signatures to the will, which are also
somewhat difficult to decipher, have been read both as Shakspere and
Shakspeare; but a close examination suggests that whatever the second
signature may be, the third is &lsquo;Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakspere
is the spelling of the alleged autograph in the British Museum copy of
Florio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Montaigne,&rsquo; but the genuineness of that
signature is disputable. <a name="citation285"></a><a href="#footnote285"
class="citation">[285]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare was the form adopted in the
full signature appended to the dedicatory epistles of the &lsquo;Venus and
Adonis&rsquo; of 1593 and the &lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; of 1594, volumes which
were produced under the poet&rsquo;s supervision.&nbsp; It is the spelling
adopted on the title-pages of the majority of contemporary editions of his
works, whether or not produced under his supervision.&nbsp; It is adopted
in almost all the published references to the poet during the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; It appears in the grant of arms in 1596, in the license to
the players of 1603, and in the text of all the legal documents relating to
the poet&rsquo;s property.&nbsp; The poet, like most of his contemporaries,
acknowledged no finality on the subject.&nbsp; According to the best
authority, he spelt his surname in two ways when signing his will.&nbsp;
There is consequently <!-- page 286--><a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>no good ground for abandoning the form
Shakespeare, which is sanctioned by legal and literary custom. <a
name="citation286"></a><a href="#footnote286"
class="citation">[286]</a></p>
<h3>Shakespeare&rsquo;s portraits.&nbsp; The Stratford bust.&nbsp; The
&lsquo;Stratford&rsquo; portrait.</h3>
<p>Aubrey reported that Shakespeare was &lsquo;a handsome well-shap&rsquo;t
man,&rsquo; but no portrait exists which can be said with absolute
certainty to have been executed during his lifetime, although one has
recently been discovered with a good claim to that distinction.&nbsp; Only
two of the extant portraits are positively known to have been produced
within a short period after his death.&nbsp; These are the bust in
Stratford Church and the frontispiece to the folio of 1623.&nbsp; Each is
an inartistic attempt at a posthumous likeness.&nbsp; There is considerable
discrepancy between the two; their main points of resemblance are the
baldness on the top of the head and the fulness of the hair about the
ears.&nbsp; The bust was by Gerard Johnson or Janssen, who was a Dutch
stonemason or tombmaker settled in Southwark.&nbsp; It was set up in the
church before 1623, and is a rudely carved specimen of mortuary
sculpture.&nbsp; There are marks about the forehead and ears which suggest
that the face was fashioned from a death mask, but the workmanship is at
all points clumsy.&nbsp; The round face and eyes present a heavy,
unintellectual expression.&nbsp; The bust was originally coloured, but in
1793 Malone caused it to be whitewashed.&nbsp; In 1861 the whitewash was
removed, and the colours, as far as traceable, restored.&nbsp; The eyes are
light hazel, the hair and beard auburn.&nbsp; There <!-- page 287--><a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>have been numberless
reproductions, both engraved and photographic.&nbsp; It was first
engraved&mdash;very imperfectly&mdash;for Rowe&rsquo;s edition in 1709;
then by Vertue for Pope&rsquo;s edition of 1725; and by Gravelot for
Hanmer&rsquo;s edition in 1744.&nbsp; A good engraving by William Ward
appeared in 1816.&nbsp; A phototype and a chromo-phototype, issued by the
New Shakspere Society, are the best reproductions for the purposes of
study.&nbsp; The pretentious painting known as the &lsquo;Stratford&rsquo;
portrait, and presented in 1867 by W. O. Hunt, town clerk of Stratford, to
the Birthplace Museum, where it is very prominently displayed, was probably
painted from the bust late in the eighteenth century; it lacks either
historic or artistic interest.</p>
<h3>Droeshout&rsquo;s engraving.</h3>
<p>The engraved portrait&mdash;nearly a half-length&mdash;which was printed
on the title-page of the folio of 1623, was by Martin Droeshout.&nbsp; On
the opposite page lines by Ben Jonson congratulate &lsquo;the graver&rsquo;
on having satisfactorily &lsquo;hit&rsquo; the poet&rsquo;s
&lsquo;face.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jonson&rsquo;s testimony does no credit to his
artistic discernment; the expression of countenance, which is very crudely
rendered, is neither distinctive nor lifelike.&nbsp; The face is long and
the forehead high; the top of the head is bald, but the hair falls in
abundance over the ears.&nbsp; There is a scanty moustache and a thin tuft
under the lower lip.&nbsp; A stiff and wide collar, projecting
horizontally, conceals the neck.&nbsp; The coat is closely buttoned and
elaborately bordered, especially at the shoulders.&nbsp; The dimensions of
the head and face are disproportionately large as <!-- page 288--><a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>compared with those
of the body.&nbsp; In the unique proof copy which belonged to
Halliwell-Phillipps (now with his collection in America) the tone is
clearer than in the ordinary copies, and the shadows are less darkened by
cross-hatching and coarse dotting.&nbsp; The engraver, Martin Droeshout,
belonged to a Flemish family of painters and engravers long settled in
London, where he was born in 1601.&nbsp; He was thus fifteen years old at
the time of Shakespeare&rsquo;s death in 1616, and it is consequently
improbable that he had any personal knowledge of the dramatist.&nbsp; The
engraving was doubtless produced by Droeshout very shortly before the
publication of the First Folio in 1623, when he had completed his
twenty-second year.&nbsp; It thus belongs to the outset of the
engraver&rsquo;s professional career, in which he never achieved extended
practice or reputation.&nbsp; A copy of the Droeshout engraving, by William
Marshall, was prefixed to Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Poems&rsquo; in 1640,
and William Faithorne made another copy for the frontispiece of the edition
of &lsquo;The Rape of Lucrece&rsquo; published in 1655.</p>
<h3>The &lsquo;Droeshout&rsquo; painting.</h3>
<p>There is little doubt that young Droeshout in fashioning his engraving
worked from a painting, and there is a likelihood that the original picture
from which the youthful engraver worked has lately come to light.&nbsp; As
recently as 1892 Mr. Edgar Flower, of Stratford-on-Avon, discovered in the
possession of Mr. H. C. Clements, a private gentleman with artistic tastes
residing at Peckham Rye, a portrait alleged to represent Shakespeare.&nbsp;
The picture, which was faded and somewhat <!-- page 289--><a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>worm-eaten, dated
beyond all doubt from the early years of the seventeenth century.&nbsp; It
was painted on a panel formed of two planks of old elm, and in the upper
left-hand corner was the inscription &lsquo;Will<sup>m</sup> Shakespeare,
1609.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Clements purchased the portrait of an obscure dealer
about 1840, and knew nothing of its history, beyond what he set down on a
slip of paper when he acquired it.&nbsp; The note that he then wrote and
pasted on the box in which he preserved the picture, ran as follows:
&lsquo;The original portrait of Shakespeare, from which the now famous
Droeshout engraving was taken and inserted in the first collected edition
of his works, published in 1623, being seven years after his death.&nbsp;
The picture was painted nine [<i>ver&egrave;</i> seven] years before his
death, and consequently sixteen [<i>ver&egrave;</i> fourteen] years before
it was published. . . .&nbsp; The picture was publicly exhibited in London
seventy years ago, and many thousands went to see it.&rsquo;&nbsp; In all
its details and in its comparative dimensions, especially in the
disproportion between the size of the head and that of the body, this
picture is identical with the Droeshout engraving.&nbsp; Though coarsely
and stiffly drawn, the face is far more skilfully presented than in the
engraving, and the expression of countenance betrays some artistic
sentiment which is absent from the print.&nbsp; Connoisseurs, including Sir
Edward Poynter, Mr. Sidney Colvin, and Mr. Lionel Cust, have almost
unreservedly pronounced the picture to be anterior in date to the
engraving, and they have reached the conclusion that in all probability
Martin Droeshout <!-- page 290--><a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>directly based his work upon the
painting.&nbsp; Influences of an early seventeenth-century Flemish school
are plainly discernible in the picture, and it is just possible that it is
the production of an uncle of the young engraver Martin Droeshout, who bore
the same name as his nephew, and was naturalised in this country on January
25, 1608, when he was described as a &lsquo;painter of
Brabant.&rsquo;&nbsp; Although the history of the portrait rests on
critical conjecture and on no external contemporary evidence, there seems
good ground for regarding it as a portrait of Shakespeare painted in his
lifetime&mdash;in the forty-fifth year of his age.&nbsp; No other pictorial
representation of the poet has equally serious claims to be treated as
contemporary with himself, and it therefore presents features of unique
interest.&nbsp; On the death of its owner, Mr. Clements, in 1895, the
painting was purchased by Mrs. Charles Flower, and was presented to the
Memorial Picture Gallery at Stratford, where it now hangs.&nbsp; No attempt
at restoration has been made.&nbsp; A photogravure forms the frontispiece
to the present volume. <a name="citation290"></a><a href="#footnote290"
class="citation">[290]</a></p>
<p>Of the same type as the Droeshout engraving, although less closely
resembling it than the picture just described, is the &lsquo;Ely
House&rsquo; portrait (now the property of the Birthplace Trustees at
Stratford), <!-- page 291--><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>which formerly belonged to Thomas Turton, Bishop of Ely, and it
is inscribed &lsquo;&AElig;. 39 x. 1603.&rsquo; <a
name="citation291a"></a><a href="#footnote291a"
class="citation">[291a]</a>&nbsp; This painting is of high artistic
value.&nbsp; The features are of a far more attractive and intellectual
cast than in either the Droeshout painting or engraving, and the many
differences in detail raise doubts as to whether the person represented can
have been intended for Shakespeare.&nbsp; Experts are of opinion that the
picture was painted early in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Early in Charles II&rsquo;s reign Lord Chancellor Clarendon added a
portrait of Shakespeare to his great gallery in his house in St.
James&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mention is made of it in a letter from the diarist
John Evelyn to his friend Samuel Pepys in 1689, but Clarendon&rsquo;s
collection was dispersed at the end of the seventeenth century and the
picture has not been traced. <a name="citation291b"></a><a

<p>Of the numerous extant paintings which have been described as portraits
of Shakespeare, only the &lsquo;Droeshout&rsquo; portrait and the Ely House
portrait, both of which are at Stratford, bear any definable resemblance to
the folio engraving or the bust in the church. <a
name="citation291c"></a><a href="#footnote291c"
class="citation">[291c]</a>&nbsp; In spite of their <!-- page 292--><a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>admitted
imperfections, those presentments can alone be held indisputably to have
been honestly designed to depict the poet&rsquo;s features.&nbsp; They must
be treated as the standards of authenticity in judging of the genuineness
of other portraits claiming to be of an early date.</p>
<h3>The &lsquo;Chandos&rsquo; portrait.</h3>
<p>Of other alleged portraits which are extant, the most famous and
interesting is the &lsquo;Chandos&rsquo; portrait, now in the National
Portrait Gallery.&nbsp; Its pedigree suggests that it was intended to
represent the poet, but numerous and conspicuous divergences from the
authenticated likenesses show that it was painted from fanciful
descriptions of him some years after his death.&nbsp; The face is bearded,
and rings adorn the ears.&nbsp; Oldys reported that it was from the brush
of Burbage, Shakespeare&rsquo;s fellow-actor, who had some reputation as a
limner, <a name="citation292"></a><a href="#footnote292"
class="citation">[292]</a> and that it had belonged to Joseph Taylor, an
actor contemporary with Shakespeare.&nbsp; These rumours are not
corroborated; but there is no doubt that it was at one time the property of
D&rsquo;Avenant, and that it subsequently belonged successively to the
actor <!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>Betterton and to Mrs. Barry the actress.&nbsp; In 1693 Sir
Godfrey Kneller made a copy as a gift for Dryden.&nbsp; After Mrs
Barry&rsquo;s death in 1713 it was purchased for forty guineas by Robert
Keck, a barrister of the Inner Temple.&nbsp; At length it reached the hands
of one John Nichols, whose daughter married James Brydges, third duke of
Chandos.&nbsp; In due time the Duke became the owner of the picture, and it
subsequently passed, through Chandos&rsquo;s daughter, to her husband, the
first Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, whose son, the second Duke of
Buckingham and Chandos, sold it with the rest of his effects at Stowe in
1848, when it was purchased by the Earl of Ellesmere.&nbsp; The latter
presented it to the nation.&nbsp; Edward Capell many years before presented
a copy by Ranelagh Barret to Trinity College, Cambridge, and other copies
are attributed to Sir Joshua Reynolds and Ozias Humphrey (1783).&nbsp; It
was engraved by George Vertue in 1719 for Pope&rsquo;s edition (1725), and
often later, one of the best engravings being by Vandergucht.&nbsp; A good
lithograph from a tracing by Sir George Scharf was published by the
trustees of the National Portrait Gallery in 1864.&nbsp; The Baroness
Burdett-Coutts purchased in 1875 a portrait of similar type, which is said,
somewhat doubtfully, to have belonged to John lord Lumley, who died in
1609, and to have formed part of a collection of portraits of the great men
of his day at his house, Lumley Castle, Durham.&nbsp; Its early history is
not positively authenticated, and it may well be an early copy of the
Chandos portrait.&nbsp; The <!-- page 294--><a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>&lsquo;Lumley&rsquo; painting was finely
chromo-lithographed in 1863 by Vincent Brooks.</p>
<h3>The &lsquo;Jansen&rsquo; portrait.</h3>
<p>The so-called &lsquo;Jansen&rsquo; or Janssens portrait, which belongs
to Lady Guendolen Ramsden, daughter of the Duke of Somerset, and is now at
her residence at Bulstrode, was first doubtfully identified about 1770,
when in the possession of Charles Jennens.&nbsp; Janssens did not come to
England before Shakespeare&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; It is a fine portrait, but
is unlike any other that has been associated with the dramatist.&nbsp; An
admirable mezzotint by Richard Earlom was issued in 1811.</p>
<h3>The &lsquo;Felton&rsquo; portrait.</h3>
<p>The &lsquo;Felton&rsquo; portrait, a small head on a panel, with a high
and very bald forehead (belonging since 1873 to the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts), was purchased by S. Felton of Drayton, Shropshire, in 1792
of J. Wilson, the owner of the Shakespeare Museum in Pall Mall; it bears a
late inscription, &lsquo;Gul.&nbsp; Shakespear 1597, R. B.&rsquo;
[<i>i.e.</i> Richard Burbage].&nbsp; It was engraved by Josiah Boydell for
George Steevens in 1797, and by James Neagle for Isaac Reed&rsquo;s edition
in 1803.&nbsp; Fuseli declared it to be the work of a Dutch artist, but the
painters Romney and Lawrence regarded it as of English workmanship of the
sixteenth century.&nbsp; Steevens held that it was the original picture
whence both Droeshout and Marshall made their engravings, but there are
practically no points of resemblance between it and the prints.</p>

<h3>The &lsquo;Soest&rsquo; portrait.</h3>
<p>The &lsquo;Soest&rsquo; or &lsquo;Zoust&rsquo; portrait&mdash;in the
possession of Sir John Lister-Kaye of the Grange, <!-- page 295--><a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>Wakefield&mdash;was
in the collection of Thomas Wright, painter, of Covent Garden in 1725, when
John Simon engraved it.&nbsp; Soest was born twenty-one years after
Shakespeare&rsquo;s death, and the portrait is only on fanciful grounds
identified with the poet.&nbsp; A chalk drawing by John Michael Wright,
obviously inspired by the Soest portrait, is the property of Sir Arthur
Hodgson of Clopton House, and is on loan at the Memorial Gallery,
Stratford.</p>
<h3>Miniatures.</h3>
<p>A well-executed miniature by Hilliard, at one time in the possession of
William Somerville the poet, and now the property Of Sir Stafford
Northcote, bart., was engraved by Agar for vol. ii. of the &lsquo;Variorum
Shakespeare&rsquo; of 1821, and in Wivell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Inquiry,&rsquo;
1827.&nbsp; It has little claim to attention as a portrait of the
dramatist.&nbsp; Another miniature (called the &lsquo;Auriol&rsquo;
portrait), of doubtful authenticity, formerly belonged to Mr. Lumsden
Propert, and a third is at Warwick Castle.</p>
<h3>The Garrick Club bust.</h3>
<p>A bust, said to be of Shakespeare, was discovered in 1845 bricked up in
a wall in Spode and Copeland&rsquo;s china warehouse in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
Fields.&nbsp; The warehouse had been erected on the site of the
Duke&rsquo;s Theatre, which was built by D&rsquo;Avenant in 1660.&nbsp; The
bust, which is of black terra cotta, and bears traces of Italian
workmanship, is believed to have adorned the proscenium of the Duke&rsquo;s
Theatre.&nbsp; It was acquired by the surgeon William Clift, from whom it
passed to Clift&rsquo;s son-in-law, Richard (afterwards Sir Richard) Owen
the naturalist.&nbsp; The latter sold it to the Duke of Devonshire, <!--
page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>who
presented it in 1851 to the Garrick Club, after having two copies made in
plaster.&nbsp; One of these copies is now in the Shakespeare Memorial
Gallery at Stratford, and from it an engraving has been made for
reproduction in this volume.</p>
<h3>Alleged death-mask.</h3>
<p>The Kesselstadt death-mask was discovered by Dr. Ludwig Becker,
librarian at the ducal palace at Darmstadt, in a rag-shop at Mayence in
1849.&nbsp; The features resemble those of an alleged portrait of
Shakespeare (dated 1637) which Dr. Becker purchased in 1847.&nbsp; This
picture had long been in the possession of the family of Count Francis von
Kesselstadt of Mayence, who died in 1843.&nbsp; Dr. Becker brought the mask
and the picture to England in 1849, and Richard Owen supported the theory
that the mask was taken from Shakespeare&rsquo;s face after death, and was
the foundation of the bust in Stratford Church.&nbsp; The mask was for a
long time in Dr. Becker&rsquo;s private apartments at the ducal palace,
Darmstadt. <a name="citation296a"></a><a href="#footnote296a"
class="citation">[296a]</a>&nbsp; The features are singularly attractive;
but the chain of evidence which would identify them with Shakespeare is
incomplete. <a name="citation296b"></a><a href="#footnote296b"
class="citation">[296b]</a></p>
<h3>Memorials in sculpture.</h3>
<p><!-- page 297--><a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>A monument, the expenses of which were defrayed by public
subscription, was set up in the Poets&rsquo; Corner in Westminster Abbey in
1741.&nbsp; Pope and the Earl of Burlington were among the promoters.&nbsp;
The design was by William Kent, and the statue of Shakespeare was executed
by Peter Scheemakers. <a name="citation297"></a><a href="#footnote297"
class="citation">[297]</a>&nbsp; Another statue was executed by Roubiliac
for Garrick, who bequeathed it to the British Museum in 1779.&nbsp; A third
statue, freely adapted from the works of Scheemakers and Roubiliac, was
executed for Baron Albert Grant and was set up by him as a gift to the
metropolis in Leicester Square, London, in 1879.&nbsp; A fourth statue (by
Mr. J. A. Q. Ward) was placed in 1882 in the Central Park, New York.&nbsp;
A fifth in bronze, by M. Paul Fournier, which was erected in Paris in 1888
at the expense of an English resident, Mr. W. Knighton, stands at the point
where the Avenue de Messine meets the Boulevard Haussmann.&nbsp; A sixth
memorial in sculpture, by Lord Ronald Gower, the most elaborate and
ambitious of all, stands in the garden of the Shakespeare Memorial
buildings at Stratford-on-Avon, and was unveiled in 1888; Shakespeare is
seated on a high pedestal; below, at each side of the pedestal, stand
figures of four of Shakespeare&rsquo;s principal characters: Lady Macbeth,
Hamlet, Prince Hal, and Sir John Falstaff.</p>
<p>At Stratford, the Birthplace, which was acquired <!-- page 298--><a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>by the public in 1846
and converted into a museum, is with Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s cottage (which
was acquired by the Birthplace Trustees in 1892), a place of pilgrimage for
visitors from all parts of the globe.&nbsp; The 27,038 persons who visited
it in 1896 and the 26,510 persons who visited it in 1897 represented over
forty nationalities.&nbsp; The site of the demolished New Place, with the
gardens, was also purchased by public subscription in 1861, and now forms a
public garden.&nbsp; Of a new memorial building on the river-bank at
Stratford, consisting of a theatre, picture-gallery, and library, the
foundation-stone was laid on April 23, 1877.&nbsp; The theatre was opened
exactly two years later, when &lsquo;Much Ado about Nothing&rsquo; was
performed, with Helen Faucit (Lady Martin) as Beatrice and Barry Sullivan
as Benedick.&nbsp; Performances of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays have since
been given annually during April.&nbsp; The library and picture-gallery
were opened in 1881. <a name="citation298"></a><a href="#footnote298"
class="citation">[298]</a> A memorial Shakespeare library was opened at
Birmingham on April 23, 1868, to commemorate the tercentenary of 1864, and,
although destroyed by fire in 1879, was restored in 1882; it now possesses
nearly ten thousand volumes relating to Shakespeare.</p>

299</span>XIX&mdash;BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>
<h3>Quartos of the poems in the poet&rsquo;s lifetime.</h3>
<p>Only two of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works&mdash;his narrative poems
&lsquo;Venus and Adonis&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo;&mdash;were
published with his sanction and co-operation.&nbsp; These poems were the
first specimens of his work to appear in print, and they passed in his
lifetime through a greater number of editions than any of his plays.&nbsp;
At the time of his death in 1616 there had been printed in quarto seven
editions of his &lsquo;Venus and Adonis&rsquo; (1593, 1594, 1596, 1599,
1600, and two in 1602), and five editions of his &lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo;
(1594, 1598, 1600, 1607, 1616).&nbsp; There was only one lifetime edition
of the &lsquo;Sonnets,&rsquo; Thorpe&rsquo;s surreptitious venture of 1609;
<a name="citation299"></a><a href="#footnote299" class="citation">[299]</a>
but three editions were issued of the piratical &lsquo;Passionate
Pilgrim,&rsquo; which was fraudulently assigned to Shakespeare by the
publisher William Jaggard, although it contained only a few occasional
poems by him (1599, 1600 no copy known, and 1612).</p>
<h3>Posthumous quartos of the poems.</h3>
<p>Of posthumous editions in quarto of the two narrative poems in the
seventeenth century, there <!-- page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 300</span>were two of &lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo;&mdash;viz.
in 1624 (&lsquo;the sixth edition&rsquo;) and in 1655 (with John
Quarles&rsquo;s &lsquo;Banishment of Tarquin&rsquo;)&mdash;and there were
as many as six editions of &lsquo;Venus&rsquo; (1617, 1620, 1627, two in
1630, and 1636), making thirteen editions in all in forty-three
years.&nbsp; No later editions of these two poems were issued in the
seventeenth century.&nbsp; They were next reprinted together with
&lsquo;The Passionate Pilgrim&rsquo; in 1707, and thenceforth they usually
figured, with the addition of the &lsquo;Sonnets,&rsquo; in collected
editions of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works.</p>
<h3>The &lsquo;Poems&rsquo; of 1640.</h3>
<p>A so-called first collected edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Poems&rsquo; in 1640 (London, by T. Cotes for I. Benson) was mainly
a reissue of the &lsquo;Sonnets,&rsquo; but it omitted six (Nos. xviii.,
xix., xliii., lvi., lxxv., and lxxvi.) and it included the twenty poems of
&lsquo;The Passionate Pilgrim,&rsquo; with some other pieces by other
authors.&nbsp; Marshall&rsquo;s copy of the Droeshout engraving of 1623
formed the frontispiece.&nbsp; There were prefatory poems by Leonard Digges
and John Warren, as well as an address &lsquo;to the reader&rsquo; signed
with the initials of the publisher.&nbsp; There Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; were described as &lsquo;serene, clear, and elegantly
plain; such gentle strains as shall re-create and not perplex your
brain.&nbsp; No intricate or cloudy stuff to puzzle intellect.&nbsp; Such
as will raise your admiration to his praise.&rsquo;&nbsp; A chief point of
interest in the volume of &lsquo;Poems&rsquo; of 1640 is the fact that the
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; were printed then in a different order from that
which was followed in the volume of <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>1609.&nbsp; Thus the
poem numbered lxvii. in the original edition opens the reissue, and what
has been regarded as the crucial poem, beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which was in 1609 numbered cxliv., takes the thirty-second place in
1640.&nbsp; In most cases a more or less fanciful general title is placed
in the second edition at the head of each sonnet, but in a few instances a
single title serves for short sequences of two or three sonnets which are
printed as independent poems continuously without spacing.&nbsp; The poems
drawn from &lsquo;The Passionate Pilgrim&rsquo; are intermingled with the
&lsquo;Sonnets,&rsquo; together with extracts from Thomas Heywood&rsquo;s
&lsquo;General History of Women,&rsquo; although no hint is given that they
are not Shakespeare&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; The edition concludes with three
epitaphs on Shakespeare and a short section entitled &lsquo;an addition of
some excellent poems to those precedent by other Gentlemen.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The volume is of great rarity.&nbsp; An exact reprint was published in
1885.</p>
<h3>Quartos of the plays in the poet&rsquo;s lifetime.</h3>
<p>Of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays there were in print in 1616 only sixteen
(all in quarto), or eighteen if we include the &lsquo;Contention,&rsquo;
the first draft of &lsquo;2 Henry VI&rsquo; (1594 and 1600), and &lsquo;The
True Tragedy,&rsquo; the first draft of &lsquo;3 Henry VI&rsquo; (1595 and
1600).&nbsp; These sixteen quartos were publishers&rsquo; ventures, and
were undertaken without the co-operation of the author.</p>
<p>Two of the plays, published thus, reached five editions before 1616,
viz. &lsquo;Richard III&rsquo; <!-- page 302--><a name="page302"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 302</span>(1597, 1598, 1602, 1605, 1612) and &lsquo;1
Henry IV&rsquo; (1598, 1599, 1604, 1608, 1615).</p>
<p>Three reached four editions, viz. &lsquo;Richard II&rsquo; (1597, 1598,
1608 supplying the deposition scene for the first time, 1615);
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; (1603 imperfect, 1604, 1605, 1611), and &lsquo;Romeo
and Juliet&rsquo; (1597 imperfect, 1599, two in 1609).</p>
<p>Two reached three editions, viz. &lsquo;Henry V&rsquo; (1600 imperfect,
1602, and 1608) and &lsquo;Pericles&rsquo; (two in 1609, 1611).</p>
<p>Four reached two editions, viz. &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream&rsquo; (both in 1600); &lsquo;Merchant of Venice&rsquo; (both in
1600); &lsquo;Lear&rsquo; (both in 1608); and &lsquo;Troilus and
Cressida&rsquo; (both in 1609).</p>
<p>Five achieved only one edition, viz. &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost&rsquo; (1598), &lsquo;2 Henry IV&rsquo; (1600), &lsquo;Much Ado&rsquo;
(1600), &lsquo;Titus&rsquo; (1600), &lsquo;Merry Wives&rsquo; (1602
imperfect).</p>
<h3>Posthumous quartos of the plays.</h3>
<p>Three years after Shakespeare&rsquo;s death&mdash;in 1619&mdash;there
appeared a second edition of &lsquo;Merry Wives&rsquo; (again imperfect)
and a fourth of &lsquo;Pericles.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Othello&rsquo; was
first printed posthumously in 1622 (4to), and in the same year sixth
editions of &lsquo;Richard III&rsquo; and &lsquo;I Henry IV&rsquo;
appeared. <a name="citation302"></a><a href="#footnote302"
class="citation">[302]</a>&nbsp; The largest collections of the original
quartos&mdash;<!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>each of which survives in only four, five, or
six copies&mdash;are in the libraries of the Duke of Devonshire, the
British Museum, and Trinity College, Cambridge, and in the Bodleian
Library. <a name="citation303"></a><a href="#footnote303"
class="citation">[303]</a>&nbsp; All the quartos were issued in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s day at sixpence each.</p>
<h3>The First Folio.&nbsp; The publishing syndicate.</h3>
<p>In 1623 the first attempt was made to give the world a complete edition
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays.&nbsp; Two of the dramatist&rsquo;s intimate
friends and fellow-actors, John Heming and Henry Condell, were nominally
responsible for the venture, but it seems to have been suggested by a small
syndicate of printers and publishers, who undertook all pecuniary
responsibility.&nbsp; Chief of the syndicate was William Jaggard, printer
since 1611 to the City of London, who was established in business in Fleet
Street at the east end of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; As the
piratical publisher of &lsquo;The Passionate Pilgrim&rsquo; he had long
known the commercial value of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; In 1613 he
had extended his business by purchasing the stock and rights of a rival
pirate, James Roberts, who had printed the quarto editions of the
&lsquo;Merchant of Venice&rsquo; and &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream&rsquo; in 1600 and the complete quarto of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; in
1604.&nbsp; Roberts had enjoyed for nearly twenty years the right to print
&lsquo;the players&rsquo; bills,&rsquo; or programmes, and he made over
<!-- page 304--><a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>that privilege to Jaggard with his other literary property.&nbsp;
It is to the close personal relations with the playhouse managers into
which the acquisition of the right of printing &lsquo;the players&rsquo;
bill&rsquo; brought Jaggard after 1613 that the inception of the scheme of
the &lsquo;First Folio&rsquo; may safely be attributed.&nbsp; Jaggard
associated his son Isaac with the enterprise.&nbsp; They alone of the
members of the syndicate were printers.&nbsp; Their three partners were
publishers or booksellers only.&nbsp; Two of these, William Aspley and John
Smethwick, had already speculated in plays of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Aspley had
published with another in 1600 the &lsquo;Second Part of Henry IV&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Much Ado about Nothing,&rsquo; and in 1609 half of
Thorpe&rsquo;s impression of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; Smethwick, whose shop was in St.
Dunstan&rsquo;s Churchyard, Fleet Street, near Jaggard&rsquo;s, had
published in 1611 two late editions of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; and
one of &lsquo;Hamlet.&rsquo;&nbsp; Edward Blount, the fifth partner, was an
interesting figure in the trade, and, unlike his companions, had a true
taste in literature.&nbsp; He had been a friend and admirer of Christopher
Marlowe, and had actively engaged in the posthumous publication of two of
Marlowe&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; He had published that curious collection of
mystical verse entitled &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Martyr,&rsquo; one poem in
which, &lsquo;a poetical essay of the Ph&oelig;nix and the Turtle,&rsquo;
was signed &lsquo;William Shakespeare.&rsquo; <a name="citation304"></a><a
href="#footnote304" class="citation">[304]</a></p>
<p>The First Folio was doubtless printed in Jaggard&rsquo;s printing office
near St. Dunstan&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; Upon Blount probably fell the chief
labour of seeing the <!-- page 305--><a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>work through the press.&nbsp; It was in
progress throughout 1623, and had so far advanced by November 8, 1623, that
on that day Edward Blount and Isaac (son of William) Jaggard obtained
formal license from the Stationers&rsquo; Company to publish sixteen of the
twenty hitherto unprinted plays that it was intended to include.&nbsp; The
pieces, whose approaching publication for the first time was thus
announced, were of supreme literary interest.&nbsp; The titles ran:
&lsquo;The Tempest,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Two Gentlemen,&rsquo; &lsquo;Measure
for Measure,&rsquo; &lsquo;Comedy of Errors,&rsquo; &lsquo;As you like
it,&rsquo; &lsquo;All&rsquo;s Well,&rsquo; &lsquo;Twelfth Night,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; &lsquo;3 Henry VI,&rsquo; &lsquo;Henry
VIII,&rsquo; &lsquo;Coriolanus,&rsquo; &lsquo;Timon,&rsquo; &lsquo;Julius
C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo; &lsquo;Antony and
Cleopatra,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cymbeline.&rsquo;&nbsp; Four other hitherto
unprinted dramas for which no license was sought figured in the volume,
viz. &lsquo;King John,&rsquo; &lsquo;1 and 2 Henry VI,&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Taming of the Shrew;&rsquo; but each of these plays was based by
Shakespeare on a play of like title which had been published at an earlier
date, and the absence of a license was doubtless due to an ignorant
misconception on the past either of the Stationers&rsquo; Company&rsquo;s
officers or of the editors of the volume as to the true relations
subsisting between the old pieces and the new.&nbsp; The only play by
Shakespeare that had been previously published and was not included in the
First Folio was &lsquo;Pericles.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>The prefatory matter.</h3>
<p>Thirty-six pieces in all were thus brought together.&nbsp; The volume
consisted of nearly one thousand double-column pages and was sold at a
pound a copy.&nbsp; Steevens estimated that the edition numbered 250
copies.&nbsp; The book was described on the title-page as published by <!--
page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>Edward
Blount and Isaac Jaggard, and in the colophon as printed at the charges of
&lsquo;W. Jaggard, I. Smithweeke, and W. Aspley,&rsquo; as well as of
Blount. <a name="citation306"></a><a href="#footnote306"
class="citation">[306]</a>&nbsp; On the title-page was engraved the
Droeshout portrait.&nbsp; Commendatory verses were supplied by Ben Jonson,
Hugh Holland, Leonard Digges, and I. M., perhaps Jasper Maine.&nbsp; The
dedication was addressed to the brothers William Herbert, earl of Pembroke,
the lord chamberlain, and Philip Herbert, earl of Montgomery, and was
signed by Shakespeare&rsquo;s friends and fellow-actors, Heming and
Condell.&nbsp; The same signatures were appended to a succeeding address
&lsquo;to the great variety of readers.&rsquo;&nbsp; In both addresses the
two actors made pretension to a larger responsibility for the enterprise
than they really incurred, but their motives in identifying themselves with
the venture were doubtless irreproachable.&nbsp; They disclaimed (they
wrote) &lsquo;ambition either of selfe-profit or fame in undertaking the
design,&rsquo; being solely moved by anxiety to &lsquo;keepe the memory of
so worthy a friend and fellow alive as was our Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;It had bene a thing we confesse worthie to haue bene wished,&rsquo;
they inform the reader, &lsquo;that the author himselfe had liued to haue
set forth and ouerseen his owne writings. . . .&rsquo;&nbsp; A list of
contents follows the address to the readers.</p>
<h3>The value of the text.</h3>
<p>The title-page states that all the plays were printed &lsquo;according
to the true originall copies.&rsquo;&nbsp; The dedicators wrote to the same
effect.&nbsp; &lsquo;As where (before) we were abus&rsquo;d with diuerse
stolne and surreptitious <!-- page 307--><a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>copies, maimed and deformed by the frauds and
stealthes of incurious impostors that expos&rsquo;d them: even those are
now offer&rsquo;d to your view cur&rsquo;d and perfect in their limbes, and
all the rest absolute in their numbers as he conceived them.&rsquo;&nbsp;
There is no doubt that the whole volume was printed from the acting
versions in the possession of the manager of the company with which
Shakespeare had been associated.&nbsp; But it is doubtful if any play were
printed exactly as it came from his pen.&nbsp; The First Folio text is
often markedly inferior to that of the sixteen pre-existent quartos, which,
although surreptitiously and imperfectly printed, followed playhouse copies
of far earlier date.&nbsp; From the text of the quartos the text of the
First Folio differs invariably, although in varying degrees.&nbsp; The
quarto texts of &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Richard II,&rsquo;
for example, differ very largely and always for the better from the folio
texts.&nbsp; On the other hand, the folio repairs the glaring defects of
the quarto versions of &lsquo;The Merry Wives of Windsor&rsquo; and of
&lsquo;Henry V.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the case of twenty of the plays in the
First Folio no quartos exist for comparison, and of these twenty plays,
&lsquo;Coriolanus,&rsquo; &lsquo;All&rsquo;s Well,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; present a text abounding in corrupt passages.</p>
<h3>The order of the plays.</h3>
<p>The plays are arranged under three
headings&mdash;&lsquo;Comedies,&rsquo; &lsquo;Histories,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Tragedies&rsquo;&mdash;and each division is separately paged.&nbsp;
The arrangement of the plays in each division follows no principle.&nbsp;
The comedy section begins <!-- page 308--><a name="page308"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 308</span>with the &lsquo;Tempest&rsquo; and ends with
the &lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale.&rsquo;&nbsp; The histories more justifiably
begin with &lsquo;King John&rsquo; and end with &lsquo;Henry
VIII.&rsquo;&nbsp; The tragedies begin with &lsquo;Troilus and
Cressida&rsquo; and end with &lsquo;Cymbeline.&rsquo;&nbsp; This order has
been usually followed in subsequent collective editions.</p>
<h3>The typography.</h3>
<p>As a specimen of typography the First Folio is not to be
commended.&nbsp; There are a great many contemporary folios of larger bulk
far more neatly and correctly printed.&nbsp; It looks as though
Jaggard&rsquo;s printing office were undermanned.&nbsp; The misprints are
numerous and are especially conspicuous in the pagination.&nbsp; The sheets
seem to have been worked off very slowly, and corrections were made while
the press was working, so that the copies struck off later differ
occasionally from the earlier copies.&nbsp; One mark of carelessness on the
part of the compositor or corrector of the press, which is common to all
copies, is that &lsquo;Troilus and Cressida,&rsquo; though in the body of
the book it opens the section of tragedies, is not mentioned at all in the
table of contents, and the play is unpaged except on its second and third
pages, which bear the numbers 79 and 80.</p>
<h3>Unique copies.</h3>
<p>Three copies are known which are distinguished by more interesting
irregularities, in each case unique.&nbsp; The copy in the Lenox Library in
New York includes a cancel duplicate of a leaf of &lsquo;As You Like
It&rsquo; (sheet R of the comedies), and the title-page bears the date 1622
instead of 1623; but it is suspected that the figures were tampered with
outside the printing office. <a name="citation308"></a><a
href="#footnote308" class="citation">[308]</a>&nbsp; Samuel Butler,
successively <!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>headmaster of Shrewsbury and Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry,
possessed a copy of the First Folio in which a proof leaf of
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; was bound up with the corrected leaf. <a
name="citation309a"></a><a href="#footnote309a"
class="citation">[309a]</a></p>
<h3>The Sheldon copy.</h3>
<p>The most interesting irregularity yet noticed appears in one of the two
copies of the book belonging to the Baroness Burdett-Coutts.&nbsp; This
copy is known as the Sheldon Folio, having formed in the seventeenth
century part of the library of Ralph Sheldon of Weston Manor in the parish
of Long Compton, Warwickshire. <a name="citation309b"></a><a
href="#footnote309b" class="citation">[309b]</a>&nbsp; In the Sheldon Folio
the opening page of &lsquo;Troilus and Cressida,&rsquo; of which the recto
or front is occupied by the prologue and the verso or back by the opening
lines of the text of the play, is followed by a superfluous leaf.&nbsp; On
the recto or front of the unnecessary leaf <a name="citation309c"></a><a
href="#footnote309c" class="citation">[309c]</a> are printed the concluding
lines of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; in place of the prologue to
&lsquo;Troilus and Cressida.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the back or verso are the
opening lines of &lsquo;Troilus and Cressida&rsquo; repeated from the
preceding page.&nbsp; <!-- page 310--><a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>The presence of a different ornamental
headpiece on each page proves that the two are not taken from the same
setting of the type.&nbsp; At a later page in the Sheldon copy the
concluding lines of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; are duly reprinted at
the close of the play, and on the verso or back of the leaf, which supplies
them in their right place, is the opening passage, as in other copies, of
&lsquo;Timon of Athens.&rsquo;&nbsp; These curious confusions attest that
while the work was in course of composition the printers or editors of the
volume at one time intended to place &lsquo;Troilus and Cressida,&rsquo;
with the prologue omitted, after &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
last page of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; is in all copies numbered 79,
an obvious misprint for 77; the first leaf of &lsquo;Troilus&rsquo; is
paged 78; the second and third pages of &lsquo;Troilus&rsquo; are numbered
79 and 80.&nbsp; It was doubtless suddenly determined while the volume was
in the press to transfer &lsquo;Troilus and Cressida&rsquo; to the head of
the tragedies from a place near the end, but the numbers on the opening
pages which indicated its first position were clumsily retained, and to
avoid the extensive typographical corrections that were required by the
play&rsquo;s change of position, its remaining pages were allowed to go
forth unnumbered. <a name="citation310"></a><a href="#footnote310"
class="citation">[310]</a></p>
<h3>Estimated number of extant copies.</h3>
<p>It is difficult to estimate how many copies survive of the First Folio,
which is intrinsically the most valuable volume in the whole range of
English literature, and extrinsically is only exceeded in value by <!--
page 311--><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>some
half-dozen volumes of far earlier date and of exceptional typographical
interest.&nbsp; It seems that about 140 copies have been traced within the
past century.&nbsp; Of these fewer than twenty are in a perfect state, that
is, with the portrait <i>printed</i> (<i>not inlaid</i>) <i>on</i> the
title-page, and the flyleaf facing it, with all the pages succeeding it,
intact and uninjured.&nbsp; (The flyleaf contains Ben Jonson&rsquo;s verses
attesting the truthfulness of the portrait.)&nbsp; Excellent copies in this
enviable state are in the Grenville Library at the British Museum, and in
the libraries of the Duke of Devonshire, the Earl of Crawford, the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts, and Mr. A. H. Huth.&nbsp; Of these probably the finest and
cleanest is the &lsquo;Daniel&rsquo; copy belonging to the Baroness
Burdett-Coutts.&nbsp; It measures 13 inches by 8&frac14;, and was purchased
by its present owner for &pound;716 2s. at the sale of George
Daniel&rsquo;s library in 1864.&nbsp; Some twenty more copies are defective
in the preliminary pages, but are unimpaired in other respects.&nbsp; There
remain about a hundred copies which have sustained serious damage at
various points.</p>
<h3>Reprints of the First Folio.</h3>
<p>A reprint of the First Folio unwarrantably purporting to be exact was
published in 1807-8. <a name="citation311"></a><a href="#footnote311"
class="citation">[311]</a>&nbsp; The best reprint was issued in three parts
by Lionel Booth in 1861, 1863, and 1864.&nbsp; The valuable
photo-zincographic reproduction undertaken by Sir Henry James, under the
direction of Howard Staunton, was issued in sixteen folio parts between
February 1864 and October 1865.&nbsp; A reduced <!-- page 312--><a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>photographic
facsimile, too small to be legible, appeared in 1876, with a preface by
Halliwell-Phillipps.</p>
<h3>The Second Folio.&nbsp; The Third Folio.&nbsp; The Fourth Folio.</h3>
<p>The Second Folio edition was printed in 1632 by Thomas Cotes for Robert
Allot and William Aspley, each of whose names figures as publisher on
different copies.&nbsp; To Allot Blount had transferred, on November 16,
1630, his rights in the sixteen plays which were first licensed for
publication in 1623. <a name="citation312a"></a><a href="#footnote312a"
class="citation">[312a]</a>&nbsp; The Second Folio was reprinted from the
First; a few corrections were made in the text, but most of the changes
were arbitrary and needless.&nbsp; Charles I&rsquo;s copy is at Windsor,
and Charles II&rsquo;s at the British Museum.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Perkins
Folio,&rsquo; now in the Duke of Devonshire&rsquo;s possession, in which
John Payne Collier introduced forged emendations, was a copy of that of
1632. <a name="citation312b"></a><a href="#footnote312b"
class="citation">[312b]</a>&nbsp; The Third Folio&mdash;for the most part a
faithful reprint of the Second&mdash;was first published in 1663 by Peter
Chetwynde, who reissued it next year with the addition of seven plays, six
of which have no <!-- page 313--><a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>claim to admission among Shakespeare&rsquo;s
works.&nbsp; &lsquo;Unto this impression,&rsquo; runs the title-page of
1664, &lsquo;is added seven Playes never before printed in folio, viz.:
Pericles, Prince of Tyre.&nbsp; The London Prodigall.&nbsp; The History of
Thomas Ld. Cromwell.&nbsp; Sir John Oldcastle, Lord Cobham.&nbsp; The
Puritan Widow.&nbsp; A Yorkshire Tragedy.&nbsp; The Tragedy of
Locrine.&rsquo;&nbsp; The six spurious pieces which open the volume were
attributed by unprincipled publishers to Shakespeare in his lifetime.&nbsp;
Fewer copies of the Third Folio are reputed to be extant than of the Second
or Fourth, owing to the destruction of many unsold impressions in the Fire
of London in 1666.&nbsp; The Fourth Folio, printed in 1685 &lsquo;for H.
Herringman, E. Brewster, R. Chiswell, and R. Bentley,&rsquo; reprints the
folio of 1664 without change except in the way of modernising the spelling;
it repeats the spurious pieces.</p>
<h3>Eighteenth-century editors.</h3>
<p>Since 1685 some two hundred independent editions of the collected works
have been published in Great Britain and Ireland, and many thousand
editions of separate plays.&nbsp; The eighteenth-century editors of the
collected works endeavoured with varying degrees of success to purge the
text of the numerous incoherences of the folios, and to restore, where good
taste or good sense required it, the lost text of the contemporary
quartos.&nbsp; It is largely owing to a due co-ordination of the results of
the efforts of the eighteenth-century editors by their successors in the
present century that Shakespeare&rsquo;s work has become intelligible <!--
page 314--><a name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>to
general readers unversed in textual criticism, and has won from them the
veneration that it merits. <a name="citation314"></a><a href="#footnote314"
class="citation">[314]</a></p>
<h3>Nicholas Rowe, 1674-1718.</h3>
<p>Nicholas Rowe, a popular dramatist of Queen Anne&rsquo;s reign, and poet
laureate to George I., was the first critical editor of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
He produced an edition of his plays in six octavo volumes in 1709.&nbsp; A
new edition in eight volumes followed in 1714, and another hand added a
ninth volume which included the poems.&nbsp; Rowe prefixed a valuable life
of the poet embodying traditions which were in danger of perishing without
a record.&nbsp; His text followed that of the Fourth Folio.&nbsp; The plays
were printed in the same order, except that he transferred the spurious
pieces from the beginning to the end.&nbsp; Rowe did not compare his text
with that of the First Folio or of the quartos, but in the case of
&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; he met with an early quarto while his
edition was passing through the press, and inserted at the end of the play
the prologue which is met with only in the quartos.&nbsp; He made a few
happy emendations, some of which coincide accidentally with the readings of
the First Folio; but his text is deformed by many palpable errors.&nbsp;
His practical experience as a playwright induced him, however, to prefix
for the first time a list of <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> to each play, to
divide and number acts and scenes on rational principles, and to mark the
<!-- page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>entrances and exits of the characters.&nbsp; Spelling,
punctuation, and grammar he corrected and modernised.</p>
<h3>Alexander Pope, 1688-1744.</h3>
<p>The poet Pope was Shakespeare&rsquo;s second editor.&nbsp; His edition
in six quarto volumes was completed in 1725.&nbsp; The poems, edited by Dr.
George Sewell, with an essay on the rise and progress of the stage, and a
glossary, appeared in a seventh volume.&nbsp; Pope had few qualifications
for the task, and the venture was a commercial failure.&nbsp; In his
preface Pope, while he fully recognised Shakespeare&rsquo;s native genius,
deemed his achievement deficient in artistic quality.&nbsp; Pope claimed to
have collated the text of the Fourth Folio with that of all preceding
editions, and although his work indicates that he had access to the First
Folio and some of the quartos, it is clear that his text was based on that
of Rowe.&nbsp; His innovations are numerous, and are derived from
&lsquo;his private sense and conjecture,&rsquo; but they are often
plausible and ingenious.&nbsp; He was the first to indicate the place of
each new scene, and he improved on Rowe&rsquo;s subdivision of the
scenes.&nbsp; A second edition of Pope&rsquo;s version in ten duodecimo
volumes appeared in 1728 with Sewell&rsquo;s name on the title-page as well
as Pope&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There were few alterations in the text, though a
preliminary table supplied a list of twenty-eight quartos.&nbsp; Other
editions followed in 1735 and 1768.&nbsp; The last was printed at
Garrick&rsquo;s suggestion at Birmingham from Baskerville&rsquo;s
types.</p>
<h3>Lewis Theobald, 1688-1744.</h3>
<p>Pope found a rigorous critic in Lewis Theobald, who, although
contemptible as a writer of original verse and <!-- page 316--><a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>prose, proved himself
the most inspired of all the textual critics of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Pope
savagely avenged himself on his censor by holding him up to ridicule as the
hero of the &lsquo;Dunciad.&rsquo;&nbsp; Theobald first displayed his
critical skill in 1726 in a volume which deserves to rank as a classic in
English literature.&nbsp; The title runs &lsquo;Shakespeare Restored, or a
specimen of the many errors as well committed as unamended by Mr. Pope in
his late edition of this poet, designed not only to correct the said
edition but to restore the true reading of Shakespeare in all the editions
ever yet publish&rsquo;d.&rsquo;&nbsp; There at page 137 appears
Theobald&rsquo;s great emendation in Shakespeare&rsquo;s account of
Falstaff&rsquo;s death (Henry V, II. iii. 17): &lsquo;His nose was as sharp
as a pen and a&rsquo; babbled of green fields,&rsquo; in place of the
reading in the old copies, &lsquo;His nose was as sharp as a pen and a
table of green fields.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1733 Theobald brought out his
edition of Shakespeare in seven volumes.&nbsp; In 1740 it reached a second
issue.&nbsp; A third edition was published in 1752.&nbsp; Others are dated
1772 and 1773.&nbsp; It is stated that 12,860 copies in all were
sold.&nbsp; Theobald made the First Folio the basis of his text, although
he failed to adopt all the correct readings of that version, but over 300
corrections or emendations which he made in his edition have become part
and parcel of the authorised canon.&nbsp; Theobald&rsquo;s principles of
textual criticism were as enlightened as his practice was triumphant.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I ever labour,&rsquo; he wrote to Warburton, &lsquo;to make the
smallest deviation that I possibly can from the text; never to alter at all
where I can by <!-- page 317--><a name="page317"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 317</span>any means explain a passage with sense; nor
ever by any emendation to make the author better when it is probable the
text came from his own hands.&rsquo;&nbsp; Theobald has every right to the
title of the Porson of Shakespearean criticism. <a
name="citation317a"></a><a href="#footnote317a"
class="citation">[317a]</a>&nbsp; The following are favourable specimens of
his insight.&nbsp; In &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; (I. vii. 6) for &lsquo;this
bank and school of time,&rsquo; he substituted the familiar &lsquo;bank and
shoal of time.&rsquo;&nbsp; In &lsquo;Antony and Cleopatra&rsquo; the old
copies (v. ii. 87) made Cleopatra say of Antony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
For his bounty,<br />
There was no winter in&rsquo;t; an Anthony it was<br />
That grew the more by reaping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the gibberish &lsquo;an Anthony it was,&rsquo; Theobald read
&lsquo;an autumn &rsquo;twas,&rsquo; and thus gave the lines true point and
poetry.&nbsp; A third notable instance, somewhat more recondite, is found
in &lsquo;Coriolanus&rsquo; (II. i. 59-60) where Menenius asks the tribunes
in the First Folio version &lsquo;what harm can your besom conspectuities
[<i>i.e.</i> vision or eyes] glean out of this character?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Theobald replaced the meaningless epithet &lsquo;besom&rsquo; by
&lsquo;bisson&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> purblind), a recognised Elizabethan word
which Shakespeare had already employed in &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; (II. ii.
529). <a name="citation317b"></a><a href="#footnote317b"
class="citation">[317b]</a></p>
<h3>Sir Thomas Hanmer, 1677-1746.</h3>
<p><!-- page 318--><a name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
318</span>The fourth editor was Sir Thomas Hammer, a country gentleman
without much literary culture, but possessing a large measure of mother
wit.&nbsp; He was speaker in the House of Commons for a few months in 1714,
and retiring soon afterwards from public life devoted his leisure to a
thorough-going scrutiny of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays.&nbsp; His edition,
which was the earliest to pretend to typographical beauty, was printed at
the Oxford University Press in 1744 in six quarto volumes.&nbsp; It
contained a number of good engravings by Gravelot after designs by Francis
Hayman, and was long highly valued by book collectors.&nbsp; No
editor&rsquo;s name was given.&nbsp; In forming his text, Hanmer depended
exclusively on his own ingenuity.&nbsp; He made no recourse to the old
copies.&nbsp; The result was a mass of common-sense emendations, some of
which have been permanently accepted. <a name="citation318"></a><a
href="#footnote318" class="citation">[318]</a>&nbsp; Hanmer&rsquo;s edition
was reprinted in 1770-1.</p>
<h3>Bishop Warburton, 1698-1779.</h3>
<p>In 1747 Bishop Warburton produced a revised version of Pope&rsquo;s
edition in eight volumes.&nbsp; Warburton was hardly better qualified for
the task than Pope, and such improvements as he introduced are mainly
borrowed from Theobald and Hanmer.&nbsp; On both these critics he
arrogantly and unjustly heaped abuse in his preface.&nbsp; The Bishop was
consequently criticised with <!-- page 319--><a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>appropriate severity for his pretentious
incompetence by many writers; among them, by Thomas Edwards, whose
&lsquo;Supplement to Warburton&rsquo;s Edition of Shakespeare&rsquo; first
appeared in 1747, and, having been renamed &lsquo;The Canons of
Criticism&rsquo; next year in the third edition, passed through as many as
seven editions by 1765.</p>
<h3>Dr. Johnson, 1709-1783.</h3>
<p>Dr. Johnson, the sixth editor, completed his edition in eight volumes in
1765, and a second issue followed three years later.&nbsp; Although he made
some independent collation of the quartos, his textual labours were slight,
and his verbal notes show little close knowledge of sixteenth and
seventeenth century literature.&nbsp; But in his preface and elsewhere he
displays a genuine, if occasionally sluggish, sense of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
greatness, and his massive sagacity enabled him to indicate convincingly
Shakespeare&rsquo;s triumphs of characterisation.</p>
<h3>Edward Capell, 1713-1781.</h3>
<p>The seventh editor, Edward Capell, advanced on his predecessors in many
respects.&nbsp; He was a clumsy writer, and Johnson declared, with some
justice, that he &lsquo;gabbled monstrously,&rsquo; but his collation of
the quartos and the First and Second Folios was conducted on more thorough
and scholarly methods than those of any of his predecessors not excepting
Theobald.&nbsp; His industry was untiring, and he is said to have
transcribed the whole of Shakespeare ten times.&nbsp; Capell&rsquo;s
edition appeared in ten small octavo volumes in 1768.&nbsp; He showed
himself well versed in Elizabethan literature in a volume of notes which
appeared in 1774, and in three further <!-- page 320--><a
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>volumes, entitled
&lsquo;Notes, Various Readings, and the School of Shakespeare,&rsquo; which
were not published till 1783, two years after his death.&nbsp; The last
volume, &lsquo;The School of Shakespeare,&rsquo; consisted of
&lsquo;authentic extracts from divers English books that were in print in
that author&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; to which was appended &lsquo;Notitia
Dramatica; or, Tables of Ancient Plays (from their beginning to the
Restoration of Charles II).&rsquo;</p>
<h3>George Steevens, 1736-1800.</h3>
<p>George Steevens, whose saturnine humour involved him in a lifelong
series of literary quarrels with rival students of Shakespeare, made
invaluable contributions to Shakespearean study.&nbsp; In 1766 he reprinted
twenty of the plays from the quartos.&nbsp; Soon afterwards he revised
Johnson&rsquo;s edition without much assistance from the Doctor, and his
revision, which embodied numerous improvements, appeared in ten volumes in
1773.&nbsp; It was long regarded as the standard version.&nbsp;
Steevens&rsquo;s antiquarian knowledge alike of Elizabethan history and
literature was greater than that of any previous editor; his citations of
parallel passages from the writings of Shakespeare&rsquo;s contemporaries,
in elucidation of obscure words and phrases, have not been exceeded in
number or excelled in aptness by any of his successors.&nbsp; All
commentators of recent times are more deeply indebted in this department of
their labours to Steevens than to any other critic.&nbsp; But he lacked
taste as well as temper, and excluded from his edition Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets and poems, because, he wrote, &lsquo;the strongest Act of
Parliament that could be framed would fail to compel readers into their
service.&rsquo; <a name="citation320"></a><a href="#footnote320"
class="citation">[320]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 321--><a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>The second edition of
Johnson and Steevens&rsquo;s version appeared in ten volumes in 1778.&nbsp;
The third edition, published in ten volumes in 1785, was revised by
Steevens&rsquo;s friend, Isaac Reed (1742-1807), a scholar of his own
type.&nbsp; The fourth and last edition, published in Steevens&rsquo;s
lifetime, was prepared by himself in fifteen volumes in 1793.&nbsp; As he
grew older, he made some reckless changes in the text, chiefly with the
unhallowed object of mystifying those engaged in the same field.&nbsp; With
a malignity that was not without humour, he supplied, too, many obscene
notes to coarse expressions, and he pretended that he owed his indecencies
to one or other of two highly respectable clergymen, Richard Amner and John
Collins, whose surnames were in each instance appended.&nbsp; He had known
and quarrelled with both.&nbsp; Such proofs of his perversity justified the
title which Gifford applied to him of &lsquo;the Puck of
Commentators.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Edmund Malone, 1741-1812.</h3>
<p>Edmund Malone, who lacked Steevens&rsquo;s quick wit and incisive style,
was a laborious and amiable arch&aelig;ologist, without much ear for poetry
or delicate literary taste.&nbsp; He threw abundance of new light on
Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography, and on the chronology and sources of his
works, while his researches into the beginnings of the English stage added
a new chapter of first-rate importance to English literary history.&nbsp;
To Malone is due the first rational &lsquo;attempt to ascertain the order
in which the plays attributed to Shakespeare were written.&rsquo;&nbsp; His
earliest results on the topic were contributed to <!-- page 322--><a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>Steevens&rsquo;s
edition of 1778.&nbsp; Two years later he published, as a supplement to
Steevens&rsquo;s work, two volumes containing a history of the Elizabethan
stage, with reprints of Arthur Brooke&rsquo;s &lsquo;Romeus and
Juliet,&rsquo; Shakespeare&rsquo;s Poems, and the plays falsely ascribed to
him in the Third and Fourth Folios.&nbsp; A quarrel with Steevens followed,
and was never closed.&nbsp; In 1787 Malone issued &lsquo;A Dissertation on
the Three Parts of King Henry VI,&rsquo; tending to show that those plays
were not originally written by Shakespeare.&nbsp; In 1790 appeared his
edition of Shakespeare in ten volumes, the first in two parts.</p>
<h3>Variorum editions.</h3>
<p>What is known among booksellers as the &lsquo;First Variorum&rsquo;
edition of Shakespeare was prepared by Steevens&rsquo;s friend, Isaac Reed,
after Steevens&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; It was based on a copy of
Steevens&rsquo;s work of 1793, which had been enriched with numerous
manuscript additions, and it embodied the published notes and prefaces of
preceding editors.&nbsp; It was published in twenty-one volumes in
1803.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Second Variorum&rsquo; edition, which was mainly a
reprint of the first, was published in twenty-one volumes in 1813.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;Third Variorum&rsquo; was prepared for the press by James
Boswell the younger, the son of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s biographer.&nbsp; It
was based on Malone&rsquo;s edition of 1790, but included massive
accumulations of notes left in manuscript by Malone at his death.&nbsp;
Malone had been long engaged on a revision of his edition, but died in
1812, before it was completed.&nbsp; Boswell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Malone,&rsquo;
as the new work is often called, appeared in twenty-one volumes in
1821.&nbsp; It is the most <!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 323</span>valuable of all collective editions of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s works, but the three volumes of preliminary essays on
Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography and writings, and the illustrative notes
brought together in the final volume, are confusedly arranged and are
unindexed; many of the essays and notes break off abruptly at the point at
which they were left at Malone&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; A new
&lsquo;Variorum&rsquo; edition, on an exhaustive scale, was undertaken by
Mr. H. Howard Furness of Philadelphia, and eleven volumes have appeared
since 1871 (&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; 2 vols., &lsquo;King Lear,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; &lsquo;Merchant of Venice,&rsquo; &lsquo;As You Like
It,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tempest,&rsquo; &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Winter&rsquo;s Tale&rsquo;).</p>
<h3>Nineteenth-century editors.</h3>
<p>Of nineteenth-century editors who have prepared collective editions of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s work with original annotations those who have most
successfully pursued the great traditions of the eighteenth century are
Alexander Dyce, Howard Staunton, Nikolaus Delius, and the Cambridge editors
William George Clark (1821-1878) and Dr. Aldis Wright.</p>
<h3>Alexander Dyce, 1798-1869.&nbsp; Howard Staunton, 1810-1874.&nbsp; The
Cambridge edition, 1863-6.</h3>
<p>Alexander Dyce was almost as well read as Steevens in Elizabethan
literature, and especially in the drama of the period, and his edition of
Shakespeare in nine volumes, which was first published in 1857, has many
new and valuable illustrative notes and a few good textual emendations, as
well as a useful glossary; but Dyce&rsquo;s annotations are not always
adequate, and often tantalise the reader by their brevity.&nbsp; Howard
Staunton&rsquo;s <!-- page 324--><a name="page324"></a><span

326</span>XX&mdash;POSTHUMOUS REPUTATION</h2>
<p>Shakespeare defied at every stage in his career the laws of the
classical drama.&nbsp; He rode roughshod over the unities of time, place,
and action.&nbsp; There were critics in his day who zealously championed
the ancient rules, and viewed with distrust any infringement of them.&nbsp;
But the force of Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius&mdash;its revelation of new
methods of dramatic art&mdash;was not lost on the lovers of the ancient
ways; and even those who, to assuage their consciences, entered a formal
protest against his innovations, soon swelled the chorus of praise with
which his work was welcomed by contemporary playgoers, cultured and
uncultured alike.&nbsp; The unauthorised publishers of &lsquo;Troilus and
Cressida&rsquo; in 1608 faithfully echoed public opinion when they prefaced
the work with the note: &lsquo;This author&rsquo;s comedies are so framed
to the life that they serve for the most common commentaries of all actions
of our lives, showing such a dexterity and power of wit that the most
displeased with plays are pleased with his comedies. . . .&nbsp; So much
and such savoured salt of wit is in his comedies that they seem for their
height of pleasure to be born in the sea that brought forth
Venus.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>Ben Jonson&rsquo;s tribute.</h3>
<p><!-- page 327--><a name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

wrote, seven years after Shakespeare&rsquo;s death: &lsquo;These plays have
had their trial already and stood out all appeals.&rsquo; <a
name="citation327a"></a><a href="#footnote327a"
class="citation">[327a]</a>&nbsp; Ben Jonson, the staunchest champion of
classical canons, noted that Shakespeare &lsquo;wanted art,&rsquo; but he
allowed him, in verses prefixed to the First Folio, the first place among
all dramatists, including those of Greece and Rome, and claimed that all
Europe owed him homage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show,<br />
To whom all scenes [<i>i.e.</i> stages] of Europe homage owe.<br />
He was not of an age, but for all time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1630 Milton penned in like strains an epitaph on &lsquo;the great
heir of fame:&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones<br />
The labour of an age in pil&egrave;d stones?<br />
Or that his hallowed reliques should be hid<br />
Under a star-ypointing pyramid?<br />
Dear son of memory, great heir of fame,<br />
What need&rsquo;st thou such weak witness of thy name?<br />
Thou in our wonder and astonishment<br />
Hast built thyself a lifelong monument.</p>

<p>Milton and I. M. S. were followed within ten years by critics of tastes
so varied as the dramatist of domesticity Thomas Heywood, the gallant
lyrist Sir John Suckling, the philosophic and &lsquo;ever-memorable&rsquo;
John Hales of Eton, and the untiring versifier of the stage and court, Sir
William D&rsquo;Avenant.&nbsp; Before 1640 Hales is said to have
triumphantly established, in a public dispute held with men of learning in
his rooms at Eton, the proposition that &lsquo;there was no subject of
which any poet ever writ but he could produce it much better done in
Shakespeare.&rsquo; <a name="citation328"></a><a href="#footnote328"

of the &lsquo;Poems&rsquo;) asserted that every revival of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays drew crowds to pit, boxes, and galleries
alike.&nbsp; At a little later date, Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were the

<h3>1660-1702.&nbsp; Dryden&rsquo;s view.</h3>
<p>After the Restoration public taste in England veered towards the French
and classical dramatic models. <a name="citation329b"></a><a
href="#footnote329b" class="citation">[329b]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
work was subjected to some unfavourable criticism as the product of nature
to the exclusion of art, but the eclipse proved more partial and temporary
than is commonly admitted.&nbsp; The pedantic censure of Thomas Rymer on
the score of Shakespeare&rsquo;s indifference to the classical canons
attracted attention, but awoke in England no substantial echo.&nbsp; In his
&lsquo;Short View of Tragedy&rsquo; (1692) Rymer mainly concentrated his
attention on &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; and reached the eccentric conclusion
that it was &lsquo;a bloody farce without salt or savour.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
Pepys&rsquo;s eyes &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; had &lsquo;no great
wit,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo; was &lsquo;the
most insipid and ridiculous play;&rsquo; yet this <!-- page 330--><a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>exacting critic
witnessed thirty-six performances of twelve of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays
between October 11, 1660, and February 6, 1668-9, seeing
&lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; four times, and &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo; which he
admitted to be &lsquo;a most excellent play for variety,&rsquo; nine
times.&nbsp; Dryden, the literary dictator of the day, repeatedly
complained of Shakespeare&rsquo;s inequalities&mdash;&lsquo;he is the very
Janus of poets.&rsquo; <a name="citation330a"></a><a href="#footnote330a"
class="citation">[330a]</a>&nbsp; But in almost the same breath Dryden
declared that Shakespeare was held in as much veneration among Englishmen
as &AElig;schylus among the Athenians, and that &lsquo;he was the man who
of all modern and perhaps ancient poets had the largest and most
comprehensive soul. . . .&nbsp; When he describes anything, you more than
see it&mdash;you feel it too.&rsquo; <a name="citation330b"></a><a
href="#footnote330b" class="citation">[330b]</a>&nbsp; In 1693, when Sir
Godfrey Kneller presented Dryden with a copy of the Chandos portrait of
Shakespeare, the poet acknowledged the gift thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TO SIR GODFREY KNELLER.</p>
<p><i>Shakespear</i>, thy Gift, I place before my sight;<br />
With awe, I ask his Blessing ere I write;<br />
With Reverence look on his Majestick Face;<br />
Proud to be less, but of his Godlike Race.<br />
His Soul Inspires me, while thy Praise I write,<br />
And I, like <i>Teucer</i>, under <i>Ajax</i> fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writers of Charles II&rsquo;s reign of such opposite temperaments as
Margaret Cavendish, duchess of <!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>Newcastle, and Sir Charles Sedley vigorously
argued for Shakespeare&rsquo;s supremacy.&nbsp; As a girl the sober duchess
declares she fell in love with Shakespeare.&nbsp; In her &lsquo;Sociable
Letters,&rsquo; which were published in 1664, she enthusiastically, if
diffusely, described how Shakespeare creates the illusion that he had been
&lsquo;transformed into every one of those persons he hath
described,&rsquo; and suffered all their emotions.&nbsp; When she witnessed
one of his tragedies she felt persuaded that she was witnessing an episode
in real life.&nbsp; &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; she concludes, &lsquo;Shakespeare
had a clear judgment, a quick wit, a subtle observation, a deep
apprehension, and a most eloquent elocution.&rsquo;&nbsp; The profligate
Sedley, in a prologue to the &lsquo;Wary Widdow,&rsquo; a comedy by one
Higden, produced in 1693, apostrophised Shakespeare thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shackspear whose fruitfull Genius, happy wit<br />
Was fram&rsquo;d and finisht at a lucky hit<br />
The pride of Nature, and the shame of Schools,<br />
Born to Create, and not to Learn from Rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Restoration adaptations.</h3>
<p>Many adaptations of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were contrived to meet
current sentiment of a less admirable type.&nbsp; But they failed
efficiently to supersede the originals.&nbsp; Dryden and D&rsquo;Avenant
converted &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo; into an opera (1670).&nbsp;
D&rsquo;Avenant single-handed adapted &lsquo;The Two Noble Kinsmen&rsquo;
(1668) and &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo; (1674).&nbsp; Dryden dealt similarly with
&lsquo;Troilus&rsquo; (1679); Thomas Duffett with &lsquo;The Tempest&rsquo;
(1675); Shadwell with &lsquo;Timon&rsquo; (1678); Nahum Tate with
&lsquo;Richard II&rsquo; (1681), &lsquo;Lear&rsquo; (1681), and
&lsquo;Coriolanus&rsquo; (1682); John <!-- page 332--><a
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>Crowne with
&lsquo;Henry VI&rsquo; (1681); D&rsquo;Urfey with &lsquo;Cymbeline&rsquo;
(1682); Ravenscroft with &lsquo;Titus Andronicus&rsquo; (1687); Otway with
&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; (1692), and John Sheffield, duke of
Buckingham, with &lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo; (1692).&nbsp; But during
the same period the chief actor of the day, Thomas Betterton, won his spurs
as the interpreter of Shakespeare&rsquo;s leading parts, often in unrevised
versions.&nbsp; Hamlet was accounted that actor&rsquo;s masterpiece. <a
name="citation332a"></a><a href="#footnote332a"
class="citation">[332a]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;No succeeding tragedy for several
years,&rsquo; wrote Downes, the prompter at Betterton&rsquo;s theatre,
&lsquo;got more reputation or money to the company than this.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>From 1702 onwards.</h3>
<p>From the accession of Queen Anne to the present day the tide of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s reputation, both on the stage and among critics, has
flowed onward almost uninterruptedly.&nbsp; The censorious critic, John
Dennis, in his &lsquo;Letters&rsquo; on Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;genius,&rsquo; gave his work in 1711 whole-hearted commendation, and
two of the greatest men of letters of the eighteenth century, Pope and
Johnson, although they did not withhold all censure, paid him, as we have
seen, the homage of becoming his editor.&nbsp; The school of textual
criticism which Theobald and Capell founded in the middle years of the
century has never ceased its activity since their day. <a
name="citation332b"></a><a href="#footnote332b"
class="citation">[332b]</a>&nbsp; Edmund Malone&rsquo;s devotion at the end
of the eighteenth century to the <!-- page 333--><a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>biography of the poet
and the contemporary history of the stage, secured for him a vast band of
disciples, of whom Joseph Hunter and John Payne Collier well deserve
mention.&nbsp; But of all Malone&rsquo;s successors, James Orchard
Halliwell, afterwards Halliwell-Phillipps (1820-1889), has made the most
important additions to our knowledge of Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, there arose a
third school to expound exclusively the &aelig;sthetic excellence of the
plays.&nbsp; In its inception the &aelig;sthetic school owed much to the
methods of Schlegel and other admiring critics of Shakespeare in
Germany.&nbsp; But Coleridge in his &lsquo;Notes and Lectures&rsquo; <a
name="citation333"></a><a href="#footnote333" class="citation">[333]</a>
and Hazlitt in his &lsquo;Characters of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Plays&rsquo;
(1817) are the best representatives of the &aelig;sthetic school in this or
any other country.&nbsp; Although Professor Dowden, in his
&lsquo;Shakespeare, his Mind and Art&rsquo; (1874), and Mr. Swinburne in
his &lsquo;Study of Shakespeare&rsquo; (1880), are worthy followers,
Coleridge and Hazlitt remain as &aelig;sthetic critics unsurpassed.&nbsp;
In the effort to supply a fuller interpretation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
works textual, historical, and &aelig;sthetic&mdash;two publishing
societies have done much valuable work.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Shakespeare
Society&rsquo; was founded in 1841 by Collier, Halliwell, and their
friends, and published some forty-eight volumes before its dissolution in
1853.&nbsp; <!-- page 334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>The New Shakspere Society, which was founded by Dr. Furnivall in
1874, issued during the ensuing twenty years twenty-seven publications,
illustrative mainly of the text and of contemporary life and
literature.</p>
<h3>Stratford festivals.</h3>
<p>In 1769 Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;jubilee&rsquo; was celebrated for
three days (September 6-8) at Stratford, under the direction of Garrick,
Dr. Arne, and Boswell.&nbsp; The festivities were repeated on a small scale
in April 1827 and April 1830.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Shakespeare tercentenary
festival,&rsquo; which was held at Stratford from April 23 to May 4, 1864,
claimed to be a national celebration. <a name="citation334"></a><a
href="#footnote334" class="citation">[334]</a></p>
<h3>On the English stage.&nbsp; The first appearance of actresses in
Shakespearean parts.&nbsp; David Garrick, 1717-1779.</h3>
<p>On the English stage the name of every eminent actor since Betterton,
the great actor of the period of the Restoration, has been identified with
Shakespearean parts.&nbsp; Steele, writing in the &lsquo;Tatler&rsquo; (No.
167) in reference to Betterton&rsquo;s funeral in the cloisters of
Westminster Abbey on May 2, 1710, instanced his rendering of Othello as
proof of an unsurpassable talent in realising Shakespeare&rsquo;s subtlest
conceptions on the stage.&nbsp; One great and welcome innovation in
Shakespearean acting is closely associated with Betterton&rsquo;s first
name.&nbsp; He encouraged the substitution, that was inaugurated by
Killigrew, of women for boys in female parts.&nbsp; The first r&ocirc;le
that was professionally rendered by a woman in a public theatre was that of
Desdemona in &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; <!-- page 335--><a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>apparently on
December 8, 1660. <a name="citation335"></a><a href="#footnote335"
class="citation">[335]</a>&nbsp; The actress on that occasion is said to
have been Mrs. Margaret Hughes, Prince Rupert&rsquo;s mistress; but
Betterton&rsquo;s wife, who was at first known on the stage as Mrs.
Saunderson, was the first actress to present a series of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s great female characters.&nbsp; Mrs. Betterton gave her
husband powerful support, from 1663 onwards, in such r&ocirc;les as
Ophelia, Juliet, Queen Catherine, and Lady Macbeth.&nbsp; Betterton formed
a school of actors who carried on his traditions for many years after his
death.&nbsp; Robert Wilks (1670-1732) as Hamlet, and Barton Booth
(1681-1733) as Henry VIII and Hotspur, were popularly accounted no unworthy
successors.&nbsp; Colley Cibber (1671-1757) as actor, theatrical manager,
and dramatic critic, was both a loyal disciple of Betterton and a lover of
Shakespeare, though his vanity and his faith in the ideals of the
Restoration incited him to perpetrate many outrages on Shakespeare&rsquo;s
text when preparing it for theatrical representation.&nbsp; His notorious
adaptation of &lsquo;Richard III,&rsquo; which was first produced in 1700,
long held the stage to the exclusion of the original version.&nbsp; But
towards the middle of the eighteenth century all earlier efforts to
interpret Shakespeare in the playhouse were eclipsed in public esteem by
the concentrated energy and intelligence of David Garrick.&nbsp;
Garrick&rsquo;s enthusiasm for the poet <!-- page 336--><a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>and his histrionic
genius riveted Shakespeare&rsquo;s hold on public taste.&nbsp; His claim to
have restored to the stage the text of Shakespeare&mdash;purified of
Restoration defilements&mdash;cannot be allowed without serious
qualifications.&nbsp; Garrick had no scruple in presenting plays of
Shakespeare in versions that he or his friends had recklessly
garbled.&nbsp; He supplied &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; with a happy
ending; he converted the &lsquo;Taming of the Shrew&rsquo; into the farce
of &lsquo;Katherine and Petruchio,&rsquo; 1754; he introduced radical
changes in &lsquo;Antony and Cleopatra,&rsquo; &lsquo;Two Gentlemen of
Verona,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cymbeline,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless, no actor has won an equally exalted
reputation in so vast and varied a repertory of Shakespearean roles.&nbsp;
His triumphant d&eacute;but as Richard III in 1741 was followed by equally
successful performances of Hamlet, Lear, Macbeth, King John, Romeo, Henry
IV, Iago, Leontes, Benedick, and Antony in &lsquo;Antony and
Cleopatra.&rsquo;&nbsp; Garrick was not quite undeservedly buried in
Westminster Abbey on February 1, 1779, at the foot of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
statue.</p>
<p>Garrick was ably seconded by Mrs. Clive (1711-1785), Mrs. Cibber
(1714-1766), and Mrs. Pritchard (1711-1768).&nbsp; Mrs. Cibber as Constance
in &lsquo;King John,&rsquo; and Mrs. Pritchard in Lady Macbeth, excited
something of the same enthusiasm as Garrick in Richard III and Lear.&nbsp;
There were, too, contemporary critics who judged rival actors to show in
certain parts powers equal, if not superior, to those of Garrick.&nbsp;
Charles Macklin (1697?-1797) for nearly half a century, from <!-- page
337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>1735 to
1785, gave many hundred performances of a masterly rendering of
Shylock.&nbsp; The character had, for many years previous to
Macklin&rsquo;s assumption of it, been allotted to comic actors, but
Macklin effectively concentrated his energy on the tragic significance of
the part with an effect that Garrick could not surpass.&nbsp; Macklin was
also reckoned successful in Polonius and Iago.&nbsp; John Henderson, the
Bath Roscius (1747-1785), who, like Garrick, was buried in Westminster
Abbey, derived immense popularity from his representation of Falstaff;
while in subordinate characters like Mercutio, Slender, Jaques, Touchstone,
and Sir Toby Belch, John Palmer (1742?-1798) was held to approach
perfection.&nbsp; But Garrick was the accredited chief of the theatrical
profession until his death.&nbsp; He was then succeeded in his place of
predominance by John Philip Kemble, who derived invaluable support from his
association with one abler than himself, his sister, Mrs. Siddons.</p>
<h3>John Philip Kemble, 1757-1823.&nbsp; Mrs. Sarah Siddons,
1755-1831.</h3>
<p>Somewhat stilted and declamatory in speech, Kemble enacted a wide range
of characters of Shakespearean tragedy with a dignity that won the
admiration of Pitt, Sir Walter Scott, Charles Lamb, and Leigh Hunt.&nbsp;
Coriolanus was regarded as his masterpiece, but his renderings of Hamlet,
King John, Wolsey, the Duke in &lsquo;Measure for Measure,&rsquo; Leontes,
and Brutus satisfied the most exacting canons of contemporary theatrical
criticism.&nbsp; Kemble&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Siddons, was the greatest
actress that Shakespeare&rsquo;s countrymen have known.&nbsp; Her noble and
<!-- page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
338</span>awe-inspiring presentation of Lady Macbeth, her Constance, her
Queen Katherine, have, according to the best testimony, not been equalled
even by the achievements of the eminent actresses of France.</p>
<h3>Edmund Kean, 1787-1833.</h3>
<p>During the present century the most conspicuous histrionic successes in
Shakespearean drama have been won by Edmund Kean, whose triumphant
rendering of Shylock on his first appearance at Drury Lane Theatre on
January 26, 1814, is one of the most stirring incidents in the history of
the English stage.&nbsp; Kean defied the rigid convention of the
&lsquo;Kemble School,&rsquo; and gave free rein to his impetuous
passions.&nbsp; Besides Shylock, he excelled in Richard III, Othello,
Hamlet, and Lear.&nbsp; No less a critic than Coleridge declared that to
see him act was like &lsquo;reading Shakespeare by flashes of
lightning.&rsquo;&nbsp; Among other Shakespearean actors of Kean&rsquo;s
period a high place was allotted by public esteem to George Frederick Cooke
(1756-1811), whose Richard III, first given in London at Covent Garden
Theatre, October 31, 1801, was accounted his masterpiece.&nbsp; Charles
Lamb, writing in 1822, declared that of all the actors who flourished in
his time, Robert Bensley &lsquo;had most of the swell of soul,&rsquo; and
Lamb gave with a fine enthusiasm in his &lsquo;Essays of Elia&rsquo; an
analysis (which has become classical) of Bensley&rsquo;s performance of
Malvolio.&nbsp; But Bensley&rsquo;s powers were rated more moderately by
more experienced playgoers. <a name="citation338"></a><a
href="#footnote338" class="citation">[338]</a>&nbsp; Lamb&rsquo;s praises
of Mrs. Jordan (1762-1816) in Ophelia, Helena, and Viola in &lsquo;Twelfth
Night,&rsquo; are <!-- page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>corroborated by the eulogies of Hazlitt and
Leigh Hunt.&nbsp; In the part of Rosalind Mrs. Jordan is reported on all
sides to have beaten Mrs. Siddons out of the field.</p>
<h3>William Charles Macready, 1793-1873.</h3>
<p>The torch thus lit by Garrick, by the Kembles, by Kean and his
contemporaries was worthily kept alive by William Charles Macready, a
cultivated and conscientious actor, who, during a professional career of
more than forty years (1810-1851), assumed every great part in
Shakespearean tragedy.&nbsp; Although Macready lacked the classical bearing
of Kemble or the intense passion of Kean, he won as the interpreter of
Shakespeare the whole-hearted suffrages of the educated public.&nbsp;
Macready&rsquo;s chief associate in women characters was Helen Faucit
(1820-1898, afterwards Lady Martin), whose refined impersonations of
Imogen, Beatrice, Juliet, and Rosalind form an attractive chapter in the
history of the stage.</p>
<h3>Recent revivals.</h3>
<p>The most notable tribute paid to Shakespeare by any actor-manager of
recent times was paid by Samuel Phelps (1804-1878), who gave during his
tenure of Sadler&rsquo;s Wells Theatre between 1844 and 1862 competent
representations of all the plays save six; only &lsquo;Richard II,&rsquo;
the three parts of &lsquo;Henry VI,&rsquo; &lsquo;Troilus and
Cressida,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Titus Andronicus&rsquo; were omitted.&nbsp; Sir
Henry Irving, who since 1878 has been ably seconded by Miss Ellen Terry,
has revived at the Lyceum Theatre between 1874 and the present time eleven
plays (&lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo; &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Richard III,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Merchant of Venice,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Much Ado about Nothing,&rsquo; &lsquo;Twelfth Night,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Romeo <!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>and Juliet,&rsquo; &lsquo;King Lear,&rsquo; &lsquo;Henry
VIII,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cymbeline&rsquo;), and has given each of them all
the advantage they can derive from thoughtful acting as well as from lavish
scenic elaboration. <a name="citation340a"></a><a href="#footnote340a"
class="citation">[340a]</a>&nbsp; But theatrical revivals of plays of
Shakespeare are in England intermittent, and no theatrical manager since
Phelps&rsquo;s retirement has sought systematically to illustrate on the
stage the full range of Shakespearean drama.&nbsp; Far more in this
direction has been attempted in Germany. <a name="citation340b"></a><a
href="#footnote340b" class="citation">[340b]</a>&nbsp; In one respect the
history of recent Shakespearean representations can be viewed by the
literary student with unqualified satisfaction.&nbsp; Although some changes
of text or some rearrangement of the scenes are found imperative in all
theatrical representations of Shakespeare, a growing public sentiment in
England and elsewhere has for many years favoured as loyal an adherence to
the authorised version of the plays as is practicable on the part of
theatrical managers; and the evil traditions of the stage which sanctioned
the perversions of the eighteenth century are happily well-nigh
extinct.</p>

<p>Music and art in England owe much to Shakespeare&rsquo;s
influence.&nbsp; From Thomas Morley, Purcell, Matthew Locke, and Arne to
William Linley, Sir Henry Bishop, and Sir Arthur Sullivan, every
distinguished musician has sought to improve on his predecessor&rsquo;s
setting of one or more of Shakespeare&rsquo;s songs, or has composed
concerted <!-- page 341--><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
341</span>music in illustration of some of his dramatic themes. <a
name="citation341"></a><a href="#footnote341"
class="citation">[341]</a>&nbsp; In art, the publisher John Boydell
organised in 1787 a scheme for illustrating scenes in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
work by the greatest living English artists.&nbsp; Some fine pictures were
the result.&nbsp; A hundred and sixty-eight were painted in all, and the
artists, whom Boydell employed, included Sir Joshua Reynolds, George
Romney, Thomas Stothard, John Opie, Benjamin West, James Barry, and Henry
Fuseli.&nbsp; All the pictures were exhibited from time to time between
1789 and 1804 at a gallery specially built for the purpose in Pall Mall,
and in 1802 Boydell published a collection of engravings of the chief
pictures.&nbsp; The great series of paintings was dispersed by auction in
1805.&nbsp; Few eminent artists of later date, from Daniel Maclise to Sir
John Millais, have lacked the ambition to interpret some scene or character
of Shakespearean drama.</p>
<h3>In America.</h3>
<p>In America no less enthusiasm for Shakespeare has been manifested than
in England.&nbsp; Editors and critics are hardly less numerous there, and
some criticism from American pens, like that of James Russell Lowell, has
reached the highest literary level.&nbsp; Nowhere, perhaps, has more labour
been devoted to the study of his works than that given by Mr. H. H. Furness
of Philadelphia to the preparation of his &lsquo;New Variorum&rsquo;
edition.&nbsp; The Barton collection of Shakespeareana in the Boston Public
Library is one of the most valuable extant, and the elaborate catalogue
(1878-80) contains some <!-- page 342--><a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>2,500 entries.&nbsp; First of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays to be represented in America, &lsquo;Richard
III&rsquo; was performed in New York in March 1750.&nbsp; More recently
Edwin Forrest, Junius Brutus Booth, Edwin Booth, Charlotte Cushman, and
Miss Ada Rehan have maintained on the American stage the great traditions
of Shakespearean acting; while Mr. E. A. Abbey has devoted high artistic
gifts to pictorial representation of scenes from the plays.</p>
<h3>Translations.&nbsp; In Germany.&nbsp; German translations.</h3>
<p>The Bible, alone of literary compositions, has been translated more
frequently or into a greater number of languages than the works of
Shakespeare.&nbsp; The progress of his reputation in Germany, France,
Italy, and Russia was somewhat slow at the outset.&nbsp; But in Germany the
poet has received for nearly a century and a half a recognition scarcely
less pronounced than that accorded him in America and in his own
country.&nbsp; Three of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, now in the Zurich
Library, were brought thither by J. R. Hess from England in 1614.&nbsp; As
early as 1626 &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; &lsquo;King Lear,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; were acted at Dresden, and a version of the
&lsquo;Taming of The Shrew&rsquo; was played there and elsewhere at the end
of the seventeenth century.&nbsp; But such mention of Shakespeare as is
found in German literature between 1640 and 1740 only indicates a knowledge
on the part of German readers either of Dryden&rsquo;s criticisms or of the
accounts of him printed in English encyclop&aelig;dias. <a
name="citation342"></a><a href="#footnote342"
class="citation">[342]</a>&nbsp; The earliest sign of a direct <!-- page
343--><a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>acquaintance
with the plays is a poor translation of &lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;
into German by Baron C. W. von Borck, formerly Prussian minister in London,
which was published at Berlin in 1741.&nbsp; A worse rendering of
&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; followed in 1758.&nbsp; Meanwhile J. C.
Gottsched (1700-66), an influential man of letters, warmly denounced
Shakespeare in a review of Von Borck&rsquo;s effort in &lsquo;Beitr&auml;ge
zur deutschen Sprache&rsquo; and elsewhere.&nbsp; Lessing came without
delay to Shakespeare&rsquo;s rescue, and set his reputation, in the
estimation of the German public, on that exalted pedestal which it has not
ceased to occupy.&nbsp; It was in 1759, in a journal entitled
&lsquo;Litteraturbriefe,&rsquo; that Lessing first claimed for Shakespeare
superiority, not only to the French dramatists Racine and Corneille, who
hitherto had dominated European taste, but to all ancient or modern
poets.&nbsp; Lessing&rsquo;s doctrine, which he developed in his
&lsquo;Hamburgische Dramaturgie&rsquo; (Hamburg, 1767, 2 vols. 8vo), was at
once accepted by the poet Johann Gottfried Herder in the
&lsquo;Bl&auml;tter von deutschen Art and Kunst,&rsquo; 1771.&nbsp;
Christopher Martin Wieland (1733-1813) in 1762 began a prose translation
which Johann Joachim Eschenburg (1743-1820) completed (Zurich, 13 vols.,
1775-84).&nbsp; Between 1797 and 1833 there appeared at intervals the
classical German rendering by August Wilhelm von Schlegel and Ludwig Tieck,
leaders of the romantic school of German literature, whose creed embodied,
as one of its first articles, an unwavering veneration for
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Schlegel translated only seventeen plays, and his
workmanship excels that of the <!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 344</span>rest of the translation.&nbsp; Tieck&rsquo;s
part in the undertaking was mainly confined to editing translations by
various hands.&nbsp; Many other German translations in verse were
undertaken during the same period&mdash;by J. H. Voss and his sons
(Leipzig, 1818-29), by J. W. O. Benda (Leipzig, 1825-6), by J. K&ouml;rner
(Vienna, 1836), by A. B&ouml;ttger (Leipzig, 1836-7), by E. Ortlepp
(Stuttgart, 1838-9), and by A. Keller and M. Rapp (Stuttgart,
1843-6).&nbsp; The best of more recent German translations is that by a
band of poets and eminent men of letters including Friedrich von
Bodenstedt, Ferdinand von Freiligrath, and Paul Heyse (Leipzig, 1867-71, 38
vols.)&nbsp; Most of these versions have been many times reissued, but,
despite the high merits of von Bodenstedt and his companions&rsquo;
performance, Schlegel and Tieck&rsquo;s achievement still holds the
field.&nbsp; Schlegel&rsquo;s lectures on &lsquo;Shakespeare and the
Drama,&rsquo; which were delivered at Vienna in 1808, and were translated
into English in 1815, are worthy of comparison with those of Coleridge, who
owed much to their influence.&nbsp; Wordsworth in 1815 declared that
Schlegel and his disciples first marked out the right road in
&aelig;sthetic criticism, and enjoyed at the moment superiority over all
English &aelig;sthetic critics of Shakespeare. <a name="citation344"></a><a
href="#footnote344" class="citation">[344]</a>&nbsp; Subsequently Goethe
<!-- page 345--><a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>poured forth, in his voluminous writings, a mass of criticism
even more illuminating and appreciative than Schlegel&rsquo;s. <a
name="citation345"></a><a href="#footnote345"
class="citation">[345]</a>&nbsp; Although Goethe deemed Shakespeare&rsquo;s
works unsuited to the stage, he adapted &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; for
the Weimar Theatre, while Schiller prepared &lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo;
(Stuttgart, 1801).&nbsp; Heine published in 1838 charming studies of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s heroines (English translation 1895), and acknowledged
only one defect in Shakespeare&mdash;that he was an Englishman.</p>
<h3>Modern German writers on Shakespeare.</h3>
<p>During the last half-century textual, &aelig;sthetic, and biographical
criticism has been pursued in Germany with unflagging industry and energy;
and although laboured and supersubtle theorising characterises much German
&aelig;sthetic criticism, its mass and variety testify to the
impressiveness of the appeal that Shakespeare&rsquo;s work has made to the
German intellect.&nbsp; The efforts to stem the current of Shakespearean
worship made by the realistic critic, Gustav R&uuml;melin, in his
&lsquo;Shakespearestudien&rsquo; (Stuttgart, 1866), and subsequently by the
dramatist, J. R. Benedix, in &lsquo;Die Shakespearomanie&rsquo; (Stuttgart,
1873, 8vo), proved of no effect.&nbsp; In studies of the text and metre
Nikolaus Delius (1813-1888) should, among recent German writers, be
accorded the first place; in studies of the biography and stage history
Friedrich Karl Elze (1821-1889); in &aelig;sthetic studies Friedrich
Alexander Theodor Kreyssig (1818-1879), author of &lsquo;Vorlesungen
&uuml;ber Shakespeare&rsquo; (Berlin, 1858 and 1874), and
&lsquo;Shakespeare-Fragen&rsquo; (Leipzig, 1871).&nbsp; <!-- page 346--><a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>Ulrici&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s Dramatic Art&rsquo; (first published at Halle in
1839) and Gervinus&rsquo;s Commentaries (first published at Leipzig in
1848-9), both of which are familiar in English translations, are suggestive
but unconvincing &aelig;sthetic interpretations.&nbsp; The German
Shakespeare Society, which was founded at Weimar in 1865, has published
thirty-four year-books (edited successively by von Bodenstedt, Delius,
Elze, and F. A. Leo); each contains useful contributions to Shakespearean
study.</p>
<h3>On the German stage.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare has been no less effectually nationalised on the German
stage.&nbsp; The three great actors&mdash;Frederick Ulrich Ludwig Schroeder
(1744-1816) of Hamburg, Ludwig Devrient (1784-1832), and his nephew Gustav
Emil Devrient (1803-1872)&mdash;largely derived their fame from their
successful assumptions of Shakespearean characters.&nbsp; Another of Ludwig
Devrient&rsquo;s nephews, Eduard (1801-1877), also an actor, prepared, with
his son Otto, an acting German edition (Leipzig, 1873 and following
years).&nbsp; An acting edition by Wilhelm Oechelhaeuser appeared
previously at Berlin in 1871.&nbsp; Twenty-eight of the thirty-seven plays
assigned to Shakespeare are now on recognised lists of German acting plays,
including all the histories. <a name="citation346a"></a><a
href="#footnote346a" class="citation">[346a]</a>&nbsp; In 1895 as many as
706 performances of twenty-five of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays were given in
German theatres. <a name="citation346b"></a><a href="#footnote346b"
class="citation">[346b]</a>&nbsp; In 1896 no fewer than 910 performances
were given of twenty-three plays.&nbsp; In 1897 performances of twenty-four
plays reached a total of 930&mdash;an average of <!-- page 347--><a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>nearly three
Shakespearean representations a day in the German-speaking districts of
Europe. <a name="citation347"></a><a href="#footnote347"
class="citation">[347]</a>&nbsp; It is not only in capitals like Berlin and
Vienna that the representations are frequent and popular.&nbsp; In towns
like Altona, Breslau, Frankfort-on-the-Maine, Hamburg, Magdeburg, and
Rostock, Shakespeare is acted constantly and the greater number of his
dramas is regularly kept in rehearsal.&nbsp; &lsquo;Othello,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Taming
of the Shrew&rsquo; usually prove most attractive.&nbsp; Of the many German
musical composers who have worked on Shakespearean themes, Mendelssohn (in
&lsquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rsquo;), Schumann, and Franz Schubert
(in setting separate songs) have achieved the greatest success.</p>
<h3>In France.&nbsp; Voltaire&rsquo;s strictures.</h3>
<p>In France Shakespeare won recognition after a longer struggle than in
Germany.&nbsp; Cyrano de Bergerac (1619-1655) plagiarised
&lsquo;Cymbeline,&rsquo; &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Merchant of
Venice&rsquo; in his &lsquo;Agrippina.&rsquo;&nbsp; About 1680 Nicolas
Clement, Louis XIV&rsquo;s librarian, allowed Shakespeare <!-- page
348--><a name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>imagination,
natural thoughts, and ingenious expression, but deplored his obscenity. <a
name="citation348a"></a><a href="#footnote348a"
class="citation">[348a]</a>&nbsp; Half a century elapsed before public
attention in France was again directed to Shakespeare. <a
name="citation348b"></a><a href="#footnote348b"
class="citation">[348b]</a>&nbsp; The Abb&eacute; Pr&eacute;vost, in his
periodical &lsquo;Le Pour et Contre&rsquo; (1733 et seq.), acknowledged his
power.&nbsp; But it is to Voltaire that his countrymen owe, as he himself
boasted, their first effective introduction to Shakespeare.&nbsp; Voltaire
studied Shakespeare thoroughly on his visit to England between 1726 and
1729, and his influence is visible in his own dramas.&nbsp; In his
&lsquo;Lettres Philosophiques&rsquo; (1731), afterwards reissued as
&lsquo;Lettres sur les Anglais,&rsquo; 1734 (Nos. xviii. and xix.), and in
his &lsquo;Lettre sur la Trag&eacute;die&rsquo; (1731), he expressed
admiration for Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius, but attacked his want of taste
and art.&nbsp; He described him as &lsquo;le Corneille de Londres, grand
fou d&rsquo;ailleurs mais il a des morceaux admirables.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Writing to the Abb&eacute; des Fontaines in November 1735, Voltaire
admitted many merits in &lsquo;Julius C&aelig;sar,&rsquo; on which he
published &lsquo;Observations&rsquo; in 1764.&nbsp; Johnson replied to
Voltaire&rsquo;s general criticism in the preface to his edition (1765),
and Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu in 1769 in a separate volume, which was
translated into French in 1777.&nbsp; Diderot made, in his
&lsquo;Encylop&eacute;die,&rsquo; the first stand in France against the
Voltairean position, and increased opportunities of studying
Shakespeare&rsquo;s works increased the poet&rsquo;s vogue.&nbsp; Twelve
plays were translated in De la Place&rsquo;s &lsquo;Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Anglais&rsquo; <!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 349</span>(1745-8).&nbsp; Jean-Francois Ducis
(1733-1816) adapted without much insight six plays for the French stage,
beginning in 1769 with &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; his version of which was acted
with applause.&nbsp; In 1776 Pierre Le Tourneur began a bad prose
translation (completed in 1782) of all Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, and
declared him to be &lsquo;the god of the theatre.&rsquo;&nbsp; Voltaire
protested against this estimate in a new remonstrance consisting of two
letters, of which the first was read before the French Academy on August
25, 1776.&nbsp; Here Shakespeare was described as a barbarian, whose
works&mdash;&lsquo;a huge dunghill&rsquo;&mdash;concealed some pearls.</p>
<h3>French critics&rsquo; gradual emancipation from Voltairean
influence.</h3>
<p>Although Voltaire&rsquo;s censure was rejected by the majority of later
French critics, it expressed a sentiment born of the genius of the nation,
and made an impression that was only gradually effaced.&nbsp; Marmontel, La
Harpe, Marie-Joseph Ch&eacute;nier, and Chateaubriand, in his &lsquo;Essai
sur Shakespeare,&rsquo; 1801, inclined to Voltaire&rsquo;s view; but Madame
de Sta&euml;l wrote effectively on the other side in her &lsquo;De la
Litt&eacute;rature, 1804 (i. caps. 13, 14, ii. 5.)&nbsp; &lsquo;At this
day,&rsquo; wrote Wordsworth in 1815, &lsquo;the French critics have abated
nothing of their aversion to &ldquo;this darling of our
nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The English with their bouffon de
Shakespeare&rdquo; is as familiar an expression among them as in the time
of Voltaire.&nbsp; Baron Grimm is the only French writer who seems to have
perceived his infinite superiority to the first names of the French
theatre; an advantage which the Parisian critic owed to his German <!--
page 350--><a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>blood
and German education.&rsquo; <a name="citation350a"></a><a
href="#footnote350a" class="citation">[350a]</a>&nbsp; The revision of Le
Tourneur&rsquo;s translation by Fran&ccedil;ois Guizot and A. Pichot in
1821 gave Shakespeare a fresh advantage.&nbsp; Paul Duport, in
&lsquo;Essais Litt&eacute;raires sur Shakespeare&rsquo; (Paris, 1828, 2
vols.), was the last French critic of repute to repeat Voltaire&rsquo;s
censure unreservedly.&nbsp; Guizot, in his discourse &lsquo;Sur la Vie et
les &OElig;uvres de Shakespeare&rsquo; (reprinted separately from the
translation of 1821), as well as in his &lsquo;Shakespeare et son
Temps&rsquo; (1852), Villemain in a general essay, <a
name="citation350b"></a><a href="#footnote350b" class="citation">[350b]</a>
and Barante in a study of &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; <a
name="citation350c"></a><a href="#footnote350c" class="citation">[350c]</a>
acknowledge the mightiness of Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius with comparatively
few qualifications.&nbsp; Other complete translations followed&mdash;by
Francisque Michel (1839), by Benjamin Laroche (1851), and by Emil
Mont&eacute;gut (1867), but the best is that in prose by Francois Victor
Hugo (1859-66), whose father, Victor Hugo the poet, published a rhapsodical
eulogy in 1864.&nbsp; Alfred M&eacute;zi&egrave;res&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespeare, ses &OElig;uvres et ses Critiques&rsquo; (Paris, 1860),
is a saner appreciation.</p>
<h3>On the French stage.</h3>
<p>Meanwhile &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; and &lsquo;Macbeth,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Othello,&rsquo; and a few other Shakespearean plays, became stock
pieces on the French stage.&nbsp; A powerful impetus to theatrical
representation of Shakespeare in France was given by the performance in
Paris of the chief plays by a strong company <!-- page 351--><a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>of English actors in
the autumn of 1827.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; and &lsquo;Othello&rsquo;
were acted successively by Charles Kemble and Macready; Edmund Kean
appeared as Richard III, Othello, and Shylock; Miss Smithson, who became
the wife of Hector Berlioz the musician, filled the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> of
Ophelia, Juliet, Desdemona, Cordelia, and Portia.&nbsp; French critics were
divided as to the merits of the performers, but most of them were
enthusiastic in their commendations of the plays. <a
name="citation351a"></a><a href="#footnote351a"
class="citation">[351a]</a>&nbsp; Alfred de Vigny prepared a version of
&lsquo;Othello&rsquo; for the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Fran&ccedil;ais in 1829
with eminent success.&nbsp; An adaptation of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; by
Alexandre Dumas was first performed in 1847, and a rendering by the
Chevalier de Ch&acirc;telain (1864) was often repeated.&nbsp; George Sand
translated &lsquo;As You Like It&rsquo; (Paris, 1856) for representation by
the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise on April 12, 1856.&nbsp; &lsquo;Lady
Macbeth&rsquo; has been represented in recent years by Madame Sarah
Bernhardt, and &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; by M. Mounet Sully of the
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Fran&ccedil;ais. <a name="citation351b"></a><a
href="#footnote351b" class="citation">[351b]</a>&nbsp; Four French
musicians&mdash;Berlioz in his symphony of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo;
Gounod in his opera of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; Ambroise Thomas in
his opera of &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; and Saint-Sa&euml;ns in his opera of
&lsquo;Henry VIII&rsquo;&mdash;have sought with public <!-- page 352--><a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>approval to interpret
musically portions of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h3>In Italy.</h3>
<p>In Italy Shakespeare was little known before the present century.&nbsp;
Such references as eighteenth-century Italian writers made to him were
based on remarks by Voltaire. <a name="citation352"></a><a
href="#footnote352" class="citation">[352]</a>&nbsp; The French adaptation
of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; by Ducis was issued in Italian blank verse (Venice,
1774, 8vo).&nbsp; Complete translations of all the plays made direct from
the English were issued by Michele Leoni in verse at Verona in 1819-22, and
by Carlo Rusconi in prose at Padua in 1831 (new edit. Turin, 1858-9).&nbsp;
&lsquo;Othello&rsquo; and &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; have been very
often translated into Italian separately.&nbsp; The Italian actors, Madame
Ristori (as Lady Macbeth), Salvini (as Othello), and Rossi rank among
Shakespeare&rsquo;s most effective interpreters.&nbsp; Verdi&rsquo;s operas
on Macbeth, Othello, and Falstaff (the last two with libretti by Boito),
manifest close and appreciative study of Shakespeare.</p>
<h3>In Holland.</h3>
<p>Two complete translations have been published in Dutch; one in prose by
A. S. Kok (Amsterdam 1873-1880), the other in verse by Dr. L. A. J.
Burgersdijk (Leyden, 1884-8, 12 vols.)</p>
<h3>In Russia.</h3>
<p>In Eastern Europe, Shakespeare first became known through French and
German translations.&nbsp; Into Russian &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; was
translated in 1772, &lsquo;Richard III&rsquo; in 1783, and &lsquo;Julius
C&aelig;sar&rsquo; in 1786.&nbsp; Sumarakow translated Ducis&rsquo; version
of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; in 1784 for stage purposes, while the Empress
Catherine II adapted the &lsquo;Merry <!-- page 353--><a
name="page353"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 353</span>Wives&rsquo; and
&lsquo;King John.&rsquo;&nbsp; Numerous versions of all the chief plays
followed; and in 1865 there appeared at St. Petersburg the best translation
in verse (direct from the English), by Nekrasow and Gerbel.&nbsp; A prose
translation, by N. Ketzcher, begun in 1862, was completed in 1879.&nbsp;
Gerbel issued a Russian translation of the &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; in 1880,
and many critical essays in the language, original or translated, have been
published.&nbsp; Almost every play has been represented in Russian on the
Russian stage. <a name="citation353a"></a><a href="#footnote353a"
class="citation">[353a]</a></p>
<h3>In Poland.</h3>
<p>A Polish version of &lsquo;Hamlet&rsquo; was acted at Lemberg in 1797;
and as many as sixteen plays now hold a recognised place among Polish
acting plays.&nbsp; The standard Polish translation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
collected works appeared at Warsaw in 1875 (edited by the Polish poet
Kraszewski), and is reckoned among the most successful renderings in a
foreign tongue.</p>
<h3>In Hungary.</h3>
<p>In Hungary, Shakespeare&rsquo;s greatest works have since the beginning
of the century been highly appreciated by students and by playgoers.&nbsp;
A complete translation into Hungarian appeared at Kaschau in 1824.&nbsp; At
the National Theatre at Budapest no fewer than twenty-two plays have been
of late years included in the actors&rsquo; repertory. <a
name="citation353b"></a><a href="#footnote353b"
class="citation">[353b]</a></p>
<h3>In other countries.</h3>
<p><!-- page 354--><a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
354</span>Other complete translations have been published in Bohemian
(Prague 1874), in Swedish (Lund, 1847-1851), in Danish (1845-1850), and
Finnish (Helsingfors, 1892-5).&nbsp; In Spanish a complete translation is
in course of publication (Madrid, 1885 et seq.), and the eminent Spanish
critic Men&eacute;ndez y Pelayo has set Shakespeare above Calderon.&nbsp;
In Armenian, although only three plays (&lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; &lsquo;Romeo
and Juliet,&rsquo; and &lsquo;As You Like It&rsquo;) have been issued, the
translation of the whole is ready for the press.&nbsp; Separate plays have
appeared in Welsh, Portuguese, Friesic, Flemish, Servian, Roumanian,
Maltese, Ukrainian, Wallachian, Croatian, modern Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and
Japanese; while a few have been rendered into Bengali, Hindustani, Marathi,
<a name="citation354"></a><a href="#footnote354" class="citation">[354]</a>
Gujarati, Urdu, Kanarese, and other languages of India, and have been acted
in native theatres.</p>

355</span>XXI&mdash;GENERAL ESTIMATE</h2>
<h3>General estimate.</h3>
<p>No estimate of Shakespeare&rsquo;s genius can be adequate.&nbsp; In
knowledge of human character, in wealth of humour, in depth of passion, in
fertility of fancy, and in soundness of judgment, he has no rival.&nbsp; It
is true of him, as of no other writer, that his language and versification
adapt themselves to every phase of sentiment, and sound every note in the
scale of felicity.&nbsp; Some defects are to be acknowledged, but they sink
into insignificance when measured by the magnitude of his
achievement.&nbsp; Sudden transitions, elliptical expressions, mixed
metaphors, indefensible verbal quibbles, and fantastic conceits at times
create an atmosphere of obscurity.&nbsp; The student is perplexed, too, by
obsolete words and by some hopelessly corrupt readings.&nbsp; But when the
whole of Shakespeare&rsquo;s vast work is scrutinised with due attention,
the glow of his magination is seen to leave few passages wholly
unillumined.&nbsp; Some of his plots are hastily constructed and
inconsistently developed, but the intensity of the interest with which he
contrives to invest the personality of his heroes and heroines triumphs
over halting or <!-- page 356--><a name="page356"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 356</span>digressive treatment of the story in which
they have their being.&nbsp; Although he was versed in the technicalities
of stagecraft, he occasionally disregarded its elementary conditions.&nbsp;
But the success of his presentments of human life and character depended
little on his manipulation of theatrical machinery.&nbsp; His unassailable
supremacy springs from the versatile working of his insight and intellect,
by virtue of which his pen limned with unerring precision almost every
gradation of thought and emotion that animates the living stage of the
world.</p>
<h3>Character of Shakespeare&rsquo;s achievement.</h3>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s mind, as Hazlitt suggested, contained within itself
the germs of all faculty and feeling.&nbsp; He knew intuitively how every
faculty and feeling would develop in any conceivable change of
fortune.&nbsp; Men and women&mdash;good or bad, old or young, wise or
foolish, merry or sad, rich or poor&mdash;yielded their secrets to him, and
his genius enabled him to give being in his pages to all the shapes of
humanity that present themselves on the highway of life.&nbsp; Each of his
characters gives voice to thought or passion with an individuality and a
naturalness that rouse in the intelligent playgoer and reader the illusion
that they are overhearing men and women speak unpremeditatingly among
themselves, rather than that they are reading written speeches or hearing
written speeches recited.&nbsp; The more closely the words are studied, the
completer the illusion grows.&nbsp; Creatures of the
imagination&mdash;fairies, ghosts, witches&mdash;are delineated with a like
potency, and the reader or spectator <!-- page 357--><a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>feels instinctively
that these supernatural entities could not speak, feel, or act otherwise
than Shakespeare represents them.&nbsp; The creative power of poetry was
never manifested to such effect as in the corporeal semblances in which
Shakespeare clad the spirits of the air.</p>
<h3>Its universal recognition.</h3>
<p>So mighty a faculty sets at naught the common limitations of
nationality, and in every quarter of the globe to which civilised life has
penetrated Shakespeare&rsquo;s power is recognised.&nbsp; All the world
over, language is applied to his creations that ordinarily applies to
beings of flesh and blood.&nbsp; Hamlet and Othello, Lear and Macbeth,
Falstaff and Shylock, Brutus and Romeo, Ariel and Caliban are studied in
almost every civilised tongue as if they were historic personalities, and
the chief of the impressive phrases that fall from their lips are rooted in
the speech of civilised humanity.&nbsp; To Shakespeare the intellect of the
world, speaking in divers accents, applies with one accord his own words:
&lsquo;How noble in reason! how infinite in faculty! in apprehension how
like a god!&rsquo;</p>

361</span>APPENDIX</h2>
<h3>I.&mdash;THE SOURCES OF BIOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE.</h3>
<h4>Contemporary records abundant.</h4>
<p>The scantiness of contemporary records of Shakespeare&rsquo;s career has
been much exaggerated.&nbsp; An investigation extending over two centuries
has brought together a mass of detail which far exceeds that accessible in
the case of any other contemporary professional writer.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
some important links are missing, and at some critical points appeal to
conjecture is inevitable.&nbsp; But the fully ascertained facts are
numerous enough to define sharply the general direction that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s career followed.&nbsp; Although the clues are in some
places faint, the trail never altogether eludes the patient
investigator.</p>
<h4>First efforts in biography.</h4>
<p>Fuller, in his &lsquo;Worthies&rsquo; (1662), attempted the first
biographical notice of Shakespeare, with poor results.&nbsp; Aubrey, in his
gossiping &lsquo;Lives of Eminent Men,&rsquo; <a name="citation361"></a><a
href="#footnote361" class="citation">[361]</a> based his ampler information
on reports communicated to him by William Beeston (<i>d.</i> 1682), an aged
actor, whom Dryden called &lsquo;the chronicle of the stage,&rsquo; and who
was doubtless in the main a trustworthy witness.&nbsp; A few additional
details were recorded in the seventeenth century by the Rev. John Ward
(1629-1681), vicar of Stratford-on-Avon from 1662 to 1668, in a diary and
memorandum-book written between 1661 and 1663 (ed. C. A. Severn, 1839); by
the Rev. William <!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 362</span>Fulman, whose manuscripts are at Corpus
Christi College, Oxford (with valuable interpolations made before 1708 by
the Rev. Richard Davies, vicar of Saperton, Gloucestershire); by John
Dowdall, who recorded his experiences of travel through Warwickshire in
1693 (London, 1838); and by William Hall, who described a visit to
Stratford in 1694 (London, 1884, from Hall&rsquo;s letter among the
Bodleian MSS.)&nbsp; Phillips in his &lsquo;Theatrum Poetarum&rsquo;
(1675), and Langbaine in his &lsquo;English Dramatick Poets&rsquo; (1691),
confined themselves to elementary criticism.&nbsp; In 1709 Nicholas Rowe
prefixed to his edition of the plays a more ambitious memoir than had yet
been attempted, and embodied some hitherto unrecorded Stratford and London
traditions with which the actor Thomas Betterton supplied him.&nbsp; A
little fresh gossip was collected by William Oldys, and was printed from
his manuscript &lsquo;Adversaria&rsquo; (now in the British Museum) as an
appendix to Yeowell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memoir of Oldys,&rsquo; 1862.&nbsp;
Pope, Johnson, and Steevens, in the biographical prefaces to their
editions, mainly repeated the narratives of their predecessor, Rowe.</p>
<h4>Biographers of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; Stratford topography.</h4>
<p>In the Prolegomena to the Variorum editions of 1803, 1813, and
especially in that of 1821, there was embodied a mass of fresh information
derived by Edmund Malone from systematic researches among the parochial
records of Stratford, the manuscripts accumulated by the actor Alleyn at
Dulwich, and official papers of state preserved in the public offices in
London (now collected in the Public Record Office).&nbsp; The available
knowledge of Elizabethan stage history, as well as of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
biography, was thus greatly extended.&nbsp; John Payne Collier, in his
&lsquo;History of English Dramatic Poetry&rsquo; (1831), in his &lsquo;New
Facts&rsquo; about Shakespeare (1835), his &lsquo;New Particulars&rsquo;
(1836), and his &lsquo;Further Particulars&rsquo; (1839), and in his
editions of Henslowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Diary&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Alleyn
Papers&rsquo; for the Shakespeare Society, while occasionally throwing some
further light on obscure places, foisted on Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography a
series of ingeniously forged documents which have greatly perplexed
succeeding biographers. <a name="citation362"></a><a href="#footnote362"
class="citation">[362]</a> Joseph Hunter in &lsquo;New Illustrations of
Shakespeare&rsquo; (1845) and George Russell French&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespeareana <!-- page 363--><a name="page363"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 363</span>Genealogica&rsquo; (1869) occasionally
supplemented Malone&rsquo;s researches.&nbsp; James Orchard Halliwell
(afterwards Halliwell-Phillipps) printed separately, between 1850 and 1884,
in various privately issued publications, all the Stratford archives and
extant legal documents bearing on Shakespeare&rsquo;s career, many of them
for the first time.&nbsp; In 1881 Halliwell-Phillipps began the collective
publication of materials for a full biography in his &lsquo;Outlines of the
Life of Shakespeare;&rsquo; this work was generously enlarged in successive
editions until it acquired massive proportions; in the seventh and last
edition of 1887 it numbered near 1,000 pages.&nbsp; Mr. Frederick Gard
Fleay, in his &lsquo;Shakespeare Manual&rsquo; (1876), in his &lsquo;Life
of Shakespeare&rsquo; (1886), in his &lsquo;History of the Stage&rsquo;
(1890), and his &lsquo;Biographical Chronicle of the English Drama&rsquo;
(1891), adds much useful information respecting stage history and
Shakespeare&rsquo;s relations with his fellow-dramatists, mainly derived
from a study of the original editions of the plays of Shakespeare and of
his contemporaries; but unfortunately many of Mr. Fleay&rsquo;s statements
and conjectures are unauthenticated.&nbsp; For notices of Stratford, R. B.
Wheler&rsquo;s &lsquo;History and Antiquities&rsquo; (1806), John R.
Wise&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shakespere, his Birthplace and its Neighbourhood&rsquo;
(1861), the present writer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Stratford-on-Avon to the Death of
Shakespeare&rsquo; (1890), and Mrs. C. C. Stopes&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s Warwickshire Contemporaries&rsquo; (1897), may
be consulted.&nbsp; Wise appends to his volume a tentative &lsquo;glossary
of words still used in Warwickshire to be found in Shakspere.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The parish registers of Stratford have been edited by Mr. Richard Savage
for the Parish Registers Society (1898-9).&nbsp; Nathan Drake&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespeare and his Times&rsquo; (1817) and G. W. Thornbury&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s England&rsquo; (1856) collect much material
respecting Shakespeare&rsquo;s social environment.</p>
<h4>Specialised studies in biography.&nbsp; Useful epitomes.</h4>
<p>The chief monographs on special points in Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography
are Dr. Richard Farmer&rsquo;s &lsquo;Essay on the Learning of
Shakespeare&rsquo; (1767), reprinted in the Variorum editions; Octavius
Gilchrist&rsquo;s &lsquo;Examination of the Charges . . . . of Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s Enmity towards Shakespeare&rsquo; (1808); W. J.
Thoms&rsquo;s &lsquo;Was Shakespeare ever a Soldier?&rsquo; (1849), a study
based on an erroneous identification of the poet with another William
Shakespeare; Lord Campbell&rsquo;s <!-- page 364--><a
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s Legal Acquirements considered&rsquo;
(1859); John Charles Bucknill&rsquo;s &lsquo;Medical Knowledge of
Shakespeare&rsquo; (1860); C. F. Green&rsquo;s&rsquo;
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s Crab-Tree, with its Legend&rsquo; (1862); C. H.
Bracebridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shakespeare no Deer-stealer&rsquo; (1862);
William Blades&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shakspere and Typography&rsquo; (1872); and
D. H. Madden&rsquo;s &lsquo;Diary of Master William Silence (Shakespeare
and Sport),&rsquo; 1897.&nbsp; A full epitome of the biographical
information accessible at the date of publication is supplied in Karl
Elze&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of Shakespeare&rsquo; (Halle, 1876; English
translation, 1888), with which Elze&rsquo;s &lsquo;Essays&rsquo; from the
publications of the German Shakespeare Society (English translation, 1874)
are worth studying.&nbsp; A less ambitious effort of the same kind by
Samuel Neil (1861) is seriously injured by the writer&rsquo;s acceptance of
Collier&rsquo;s forgeries.&nbsp; Professor Dowden&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shakspere
Primer&rsquo; (1877) and his &lsquo;Introduction to Shakspere&rsquo;
(1893), and Dr. Furnivall&rsquo;s &lsquo;Introduction to the Leopold
Shakspere,&rsquo; are all useful summaries of leading facts.</p>
<h4>Aids to study of plots and text.&nbsp; Concordances.&nbsp;
Bibliographies.</h4>
<p>Francis Douce&rsquo;s &lsquo;Illustrations of Shakespeare&rsquo; (1807,
new edit. 1839), &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s Library&rsquo; (ed. J. P.
Collier and W. C. Hazlitt, 1875), &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Plutarch&rsquo; (ed. Skeat, 1875), and &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Holinshed&rsquo; (ed. W. G. Boswell-Stone, 1896) are of service in tracing
the sources of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plots.&nbsp; Alexander Schmidt&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespeare Lexicon&rsquo; (1874) and Dr. E. A. Abbott&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespearian Grammar&rsquo; (1869, new edit. 1893) are valuable
aids to a study of the text.&nbsp; Useful concordances to the Plays have
been prepared by Mrs. Cowden-Clarke (1845), to the Poems by Mrs. H. H.
Furness (Philadelphia, 1875), and to Plays and Poems, in one volume, with
references to numbered lines, by John Bartlett (London and New York, 1895).
<a name="citation364"></a><a href="#footnote364"
class="citation">[364]</a>&nbsp; A &lsquo;Handbook Index&rsquo; by J. O.
Halliwell (privately printed 1866) gives lists of obsolete words and
phrases, songs, proverbs, and plants mentioned in the works of
Shakespeare.&nbsp; An unprinted glossary prepared by Richard Warner between
1750 and 1770 is at the British Museum (Addit. MSS. <!-- page 365--><a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>10472-542).&nbsp;
Extensive bibliographies are given in Lowndes&rsquo;s &lsquo;Library
Manual&rsquo; (ed. Bohn); in Franz Thimm&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Shakespeariana&rsquo; (1864 and 1871); in the
&lsquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,&rsquo; 9th edit. (skilfully
classified by Mr. H. R. Tedder); and in the &lsquo;British Museum
Catalogue&rsquo; (the Shakespearean entries in which, comprising 3,680
titles, were separately published in 1897).</p>
<h4>Critical studies.</h4>
<p>The valuable publications of the Shakespeare Society, the New Shakspere
Society, and of the Deutsche Shakespeare-Gesellschaft, comprising
contributions alike to the &aelig;sthetic, textual, historical, and
biographical study of Shakespeare, are noticed above (see pp. 333-4,
346).&nbsp; To the critical studies, on which comment has already been made
(see p. 333)&mdash;viz. Coleridge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Notes and Lectures,&rsquo;
1883, Hazlitt&rsquo;s &lsquo;Characters of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Plays,&rsquo; 1817, Professor Dowden&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shakspere: his Mind and
Art,&rsquo; 1875, and Mr. A. C. Swinburne&rsquo;s &lsquo;A Study of
Shakespeare,&rsquo; 1879&mdash;there may be added the essays on
Shakespeare&rsquo;s heroines respectively by Mrs. Jameson in 1833 and Lady
Martin in 1885; Dr. Ward&rsquo;s &lsquo;English Dramatic Literature&rsquo;
(1875, new edit. 1898); Richard G. Moulton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shakespeare as a
Dramatic Artist&rsquo; (1885); &lsquo;Shakespeare Studies&rsquo; by Thomas
Spencer Baynes (1893); F. S. Boas&rsquo;s &lsquo;Shakspere and his
Predecessors&rsquo;, (1895), and Georg Brandes&rsquo;s &lsquo;William
Shakespeare&rsquo;&mdash;an elaborately critical but somewhat fanciful
study&mdash;in Danish (Copenhagen, 1895, 8vo), in German (Leipzig, 1895),
and in English (London, 1898, 2 vols. 8vo).</p>
<h4>Shakespearean forgeries.</h4>
<p>The intense interest which Shakespeare&rsquo;s life and work have long
universally excited has tempted unprincipled or sportively mischievous
writers from time to time to deceive the public by the forgery of documents
purporting to supply new information.&nbsp; The forgers were especially
active at the end of last century and during the middle years of the
present century, and their frauds have caused students so much perplexity
that it may be useful to warn them against those Shakespearean forgeries
which have obtained the widest currency.</p>
<h4>John Jordan, 1746-1809.</h4>
<p>The earliest forger to obtain notoriety was John Jordan <!-- page
366--><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>(1746-1809),
a resident at Stratford-on-Avon, whose most important achievement was the
forgery of the will of Shakespeare&rsquo;s father; but many other papers in
Jordan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Original Collections on Shakespeare and
Stratford-on-Avon&rsquo; (1780), and &lsquo;Original Memoirs and Historical
Accounts of the Families of Shakespeare and Hart,&rsquo; are open to the
gravest suspicion. <a name="citation366a"></a><a href="#footnote366a"
class="citation">[366a]</a></p>
<h4>The Ireland forgeries, 1796.</h4>
<p>The best known Shakespearean forger of the eighteenth century was
William Henry Ireland (1777-1835), a barrister&rsquo;s clerk, who, with the
aid of his father, Samuel Ireland (1740?-1800), an author and engraver of
some repute, produced in 1796 a volume of forged papers claiming to relate
to Shakespeare&rsquo;s career.&nbsp; The title ran: &lsquo;Miscellaneous
Papers and Legal Instruments under the Hand and Seal of William
Shakespeare, including the tragedy of &ldquo;King Lear&rdquo; and a small
fragment of &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; from the original MSS. in the possession
of Samuel Ireland.&rsquo;&nbsp; On April 2, 1796 Sheridan and Kemble
produced at Drury Lane Theatre a bombastic tragedy in blank verse entitled
&lsquo;Vortigern&rsquo; under the pretence that it was by Shakespeare, and
had been recently found among the manuscripts of the dramatist that had
fallen into the hands of the Irelands.&nbsp; The piece, which was
published, was the invention of young Ireland.&nbsp; The fraud of the
Irelands, which for some time deceived a section of the literary public,
was finally exposed by Malone in his valuable &lsquo;Inquiry into the
Authenticity of the Ireland MSS.&rsquo; (1796).&nbsp; Young Ireland
afterwards published his &lsquo;Confessions&rsquo; (1805).&nbsp; He had
acquired much skill in copying Shakespeare&rsquo;s genuine signature from
the facsimile in Steevens&rsquo;s edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works of
the mortgage-deed of the Blackfriars house of 1612-13, <a
name="citation366b"></a><a href="#footnote366b" class="citation">[366b]</a>
and, besides conforming to that style of handwriting in his forged deeds
and literary compositions, he inserted copies of the signature on the
title-pages of many sixteenth-century books, and often added notes in the
same feigned hand on their margins.&nbsp; Numerous sixteenth-century
volumes embellished by Ireland in this manner are extant, and his forged
signatures and marginalia have been frequently mistaken for genuine
autographs of Shakespeare.</p>
<h4>Forgeries promulgated by Collier and others, 1835-1849.</h4>
<p><!-- page 367--><a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
367</span>But Ireland&rsquo;s and Jordan&rsquo;s frauds are clumsy compared
with those that belong to the present century.&nbsp; Most of the works
relating to the biography of Shakespeare or the history of the Elizabethan
stage produced by John Payne Collier, or under his supervision, between
1835 and 1849 are honeycombed with forged references to Shakespeare, and
many of the forgeries have been admitted unsuspectingly into literary
history.&nbsp; The chief of these forged papers I arrange below in the
order of the dates that have been allotted to them by their manufacturers.

370</span>II.&mdash;THE BACON-SHAKESPEARE CONTROVERSY.</h3>
<h4>Its source.&nbsp; Toby Matthew&rsquo;s letter.</h4>
<p>The apparent contrast between the homeliness of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Stratford career and the breadth of observation and knowledge displayed in
his literary work has evoked the fantastic theory that Shakespeare was not
the author of the literature that passes under his name, and perverse
attempts have been made to assign his works to his great contemporary,
Francis Bacon (1561-1626), the great contemporary prose-writer,
philosopher, and lawyer.&nbsp; It is argued that Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays
embody a general omniscience (especially a knowledge of law) which was
possessed by no contemporary except Bacon; that there are many close
parallelisms between passages in Shakespeare&rsquo;s and passages in
Bacon&rsquo;s works, <a name="citation370"></a><a href="#footnote370"
class="citation">[370]</a> and that Bacon makes <!-- page 371--><a
name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>enigmatic references
in his correspondence to secret &lsquo;recreations&rsquo; and
&lsquo;alphabets&rsquo; and concealed poems for which his alleged
employment as a concealed dramatist can alone account.&nbsp; Toby Matthew
wrote to Bacon (as Viscount St. Albans) at an uncertain date after January
1621: &lsquo;The most prodigious wit that ever I knew of my nation and of
this side of the sea is of your Lordship&rsquo;s name, though he be known
by another.&rsquo; <a name="citation371"></a><a href="#footnote371"
class="citation">[371]</a>&nbsp; This unpretending sentence is distorted
into conclusive evidence that Bacon wrote works of commanding excellence
under another&rsquo;s name, and among them probably Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays.&nbsp; According to the only sane interpretation of Matthew&rsquo;s
words, his &lsquo;most prodigious wit&rsquo; was some Englishman named
Bacon whom he met abroad&mdash;probably a pseudonymous Jesuit like most of
Matthew&rsquo;s friends.&nbsp; (The real surname of Father Thomas
Southwell, who was a learned Jesuit domiciled chiefly in the Low Countries,
was Bacon.&nbsp; He was born in 1592 at Sculthorpe, near Walsingham,
Norfolk, being son of Thomas Bacon of that place, and he died at Watten in
1637.)</p>
<h4>Chief exponents.&nbsp; Its vogue in America.</h4>
<p>Joseph C. Hart (U.S. Consul at Santa Cruz, <i>d.</i> 1855), in his
&lsquo;Romance of Yachting&rsquo; (1848), first raised doubts of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s authorship.&nbsp; There followed in a like temper
&lsquo;Who wrote Shakespeare?&rsquo; in &lsquo;Chambers&rsquo;s
Journal,&rsquo; August 7, 1852, and an article by Miss Delia Bacon in
&lsquo;Putnams&rsquo; Monthly,&rsquo; January, 1856.&nbsp; On the latter
was based &lsquo;The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakespeare unfolded by
Delia Bacon,&rsquo; with a neutral preface by Nathaniel Hawthorne, <!--

Shakespeare&rsquo;s career, died insane on September 2, 1859. <a

London, seems first to have suggested the Baconian hypothesis in &lsquo;Was
Lord Bacon the author of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays?&mdash;a letter to Lord
Ellesmere&rsquo; (1856), which was republished as &lsquo;Bacon and
Shakespeare&rsquo; (1857).&nbsp; The most learned exponent of this strange
theory was Nathaniel Holmes, an American lawyer, who published at New York
in 1866 &lsquo;The Authorship of the Plays attributed to
Shakespeare,&rsquo; a monument of misapplied ingenuity (4th edit. 1886, 2
vols.)&nbsp; Bacon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Promus of Formularies and
Elegancies,&rsquo; a commonplace book in Bacon&rsquo;s handwriting in the
British Museum (London, 1883), was first edited by Mrs. Henry Pott, a
voluminous advocate of the Baconian theory; it contained many words and
phrases common to the works of Bacon and Shakespeare, and Mrs. Pott pressed
the argument from parallelisms of expression to its extremest limits.&nbsp;
The Baconian theory has found its widest acceptance in America.&nbsp; There
it achieved its wildest manifestation in the book called &lsquo;The Great
Cryptogram: Francis Bacon&rsquo;s Cypher in the so-called Shakespeare
Plays&rsquo; (Chicago and London, 1887, 2 vols.), which was the work of Mr.
Ignatius Donnelly of Hastings, Minnesota.&nbsp; The author pretended to
have discovered among Bacon&rsquo;s papers a numerical cypher which enabled
him to pick out letters appearing at certain intervals in the pages of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s First Folio, and the selected letters formed words and
sentences categorically stating that Bacon was author of the plays.&nbsp;
Many refutations have been published of Mr. Donnelly&rsquo;s arbitrary and
baseless contention.</p>
<h4>Extent of the literature.</h4>
<p>A Bacon Society was founded in London in 1885 to develop and promulgate
the unintelligible theory, and it inaugurated a magazine (named since May
1893 &lsquo;Baconiana&rsquo;).&nbsp; A quarterly periodical also called
&lsquo;Baconiana,&rsquo; and issued in the same interest, was established
at Chicago in 1892.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Bibliography of the Shakespeare-Bacon
Controversy&rsquo; by W. H. Wyman, Cincinnati, 1884, gives the <!-- page
373--><a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>titles of
two hundred and fifty-five books or pamphlets on both sides of the subject,
published since 1848; the list was continued during 1886 in
&lsquo;Shakespeariana,&rsquo; a monthly journal published at Philadelphia,
and might now be extended to fully twice its original number.</p>
<p>The abundance of the contemporary evidence attesting Shakespeare&rsquo;s
responsibility for the works published under his name gives the Baconian
theory no rational right to a hearing while such authentic examples of
Bacon&rsquo;s effort to write verse as survive prove beyond all possibility
of contradiction that, great as he was as a prose writer and a philosopher,
he was incapable of penning any of the poetry assigned to
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Defective knowledge and illogical or casuistical
argument alone render any other conclusion possible.</p>

374</span>III.&mdash;THE YOUTHFUL CAREER OF THE EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON.</h3>
<h4>Southampton and Shakespeare.</h4>
<p>From the dedicatory epistles addressed by Shakespeare to the Earl of
Southampton in the opening pages of his two narrative poems, &lsquo;Venus
and Adonis&rsquo; (1593) and &lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; (1594), <a
name="citation374a"></a><a href="#footnote374a" class="citation">[374a]</a>
from the account given by Sir William D&rsquo;Avenant, and recorded by
Nicholas Rowe, of the earl&rsquo;s liberal bounty to the poet, <a
name="citation374b"></a><a href="#footnote374b" class="citation">[374b]</a>
and from the language of the sonnets, it is abundantly clear that
Shakespeare enjoyed very friendly relations with Southampton from the time
when his genius was nearing its maturity.&nbsp; No contemporary document or
tradition gives the faintest suggestion that Shakespeare was the friend or
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of any man of rank other than Southampton; and
the student of Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography has reason to ask for some
information respecting him who enjoyed the exclusive distinction of serving
Shakespeare as his patron.</p>
<h4>Parentage.&nbsp; Birth on Oct. 6, 1573.</h4>
<p>Southampton was a patron worth cultivating.&nbsp; Both his parents came
of the New Nobility, and enjoyed vast wealth.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s
father was Lord Chancellor under Henry VIII, and when the monasteries were
dissolved, although he was faithful to the old religion, he was granted
rich estates in Hampshire, including the abbeys of Titchfield and Beaulieu
in the New Forest.&nbsp; He was created Earl of Southampton early in Edward
VI&rsquo;s reign, and, dying shortly afterwards, was succeeded by his only
son, the father of Shakespeare&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; The second earl loved
magnificence in his household.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was highly reverenced and
favoured of all that were of his own rank, and bravely attended and served
by the <!-- page 375--><a name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
375</span>best gentlemen of those counties wherein he lived.&nbsp; His
muster-roll never consisted of four lacqueys and a coachman, but of a whole
troop of at least a hundred well-mounted gentlemen and yeomen.&rsquo; <a
name="citation375a"></a><a href="#footnote375a"
class="citation">[375a]</a>&nbsp; The second earl remained a Catholic, like
his father, and a chivalrous avowal of sympathy with Mary Queen of Scots
procured him a term of imprisonment in the year preceding his distinguished
son&rsquo;s birth.&nbsp; At a youthful age he married a lady of fortune,
Mary Browne, daughter of the first Viscount Montague, also a
Catholic.&nbsp; Her portrait, now at Welbeck, was painted in her early
married days, and shows regularly formed features beneath bright auburn
hair.&nbsp; Two sons and a daughter were the issue of the union.&nbsp;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s friend, the second son, was born at her father&rsquo;s
residence, Cowdray House, near Midhurst, on October 6, 1573.&nbsp; He was
thus Shakespeare&rsquo;s junior by nine years and a half.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
goodly boy, God bless him!&rsquo; exclaimed the gratified father, writing
of his birth to a friend. <a name="citation375b"></a><a
href="#footnote375b" class="citation">[375b]</a>&nbsp; But the father
barely survived the boy&rsquo;s infancy.&nbsp; He died at the early age of
thirty-five&mdash;two days before the child&rsquo;s eighth birthday.&nbsp;
The elder son was already dead.&nbsp; Thus, on October 4, 1581, the second
and only surviving son became third Earl of Southampton, and entered on his
great inheritance. <a name="citation375c"></a><a href="#footnote375c"
class="citation">[375c]</a></p>
<h4>Education.</h4>
<p>As was customary in the case of an infant peer, the little earl became a
royal ward&mdash;&lsquo;a child of state&rsquo;&mdash;and Lord Burghley,
the Prime Minister, acted as the boy&rsquo;s guardian in the Queen&rsquo;s
behalf.&nbsp; Burghley had good reason to be satisfied with his
ward&rsquo;s intellectual promise.&nbsp; &lsquo;He spent,&rsquo; wrote a
contemporary, &lsquo;his childhood and other younger terms in the study of
good letters.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the age of twelve, in the autumn of 1585, he
was admitted to St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, &lsquo;the sweetest
nurse of knowledge in all the University.&rsquo;&nbsp; Southampton breathed
easily the cultured <!-- page 376--><a name="page376"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 376</span>atmosphere.&nbsp; Next summer he sent his
guardian, Burghley, an essay in Ciceronian Latin on the somewhat cynical
text that &lsquo;All men are moved to the pursuit of virtue by the hope of
reward.&rsquo;&nbsp; The argument, if unconvincing, is precocious.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Every man,&rsquo; the boy tells us, &lsquo;no matter how well or how
ill endowed with the graces of humanity, whether in the enjoyment of great
honour or condemned to obscurity, experiences that yearning for glory which
alone begets virtuous endeavour.&rsquo;&nbsp; The paper, still preserved at
Hatfield, is a model of calligraphy; every letter is shaped with delicate
regularity, and betrays a refinement most uncommon in boys of thirteen. <a
name="citation376a"></a><a href="#footnote376a"
class="citation">[376a]</a>&nbsp; Southampton remained at the University
for some two years, graduating M.A. at sixteen in 1589.&nbsp; Throughout
his after life he cherished for his college &lsquo;great love and
affection.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving Cambridge, Southampton entered his name at Gray&rsquo;s
Inn.&nbsp; Some knowledge of law was deemed needful in one who was to
control a landed property that was not only large already but likely to
grow. <a name="citation376b"></a><a href="#footnote376b"
class="citation">[376b]</a>&nbsp; Meanwhile he was sedulously cultivating
his literary tastes.&nbsp; He took into his &lsquo;pay and patronage&rsquo;
John Florio, the well-known author and Italian tutor, and was soon,
according to Florio&rsquo;s testimony, as thoroughly versed in Italian as
&lsquo;teaching or learning&rsquo; could make him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When he was young,&rsquo; wrote a later admirer, &lsquo;no
ornament of youth was wanting in him;&rsquo; and it was naturally to the
Court that his friends sent him at an early age to display his varied
graces.&nbsp; He can hardly have been more than seventeen when he was
presented to his sovereign.&nbsp; She showed him kindly notice, and the
Earl of Essex, her brilliant favourite, acknowledged his fascination.&nbsp;
Thenceforth Essex displayed in <!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 377</span>his welfare a brotherly interest which proved
in course of time a very doubtful blessing.</p>
<h4>Recognition of Southampton&rsquo;s youthful beauty.</h4>
<p>While still a boy, Southampton entered with as much zest into the sports
and dissipations of his fellow courtiers as into their literary and
artistic pursuits.&nbsp; At tennis, in jousts and tournaments, he achieved
distinction; nor was he a stranger to the delights of gambling at
primero.&nbsp; In 1592, when he was in his eighteenth year, he was
recognised as the most handsome and accomplished of all the young lords who
frequented the royal presence.&nbsp; In the autumn of that year Elizabeth
paid Oxford a visit in state.&nbsp; Southampton was in the throng of
noblemen who bore her company.&nbsp; In a Latin poem describing the
brilliant ceremonial, which was published at the time at the University
Press, eulogy was lavished without stint on all the Queen&rsquo;s
attendants; but the academic poet declared that Southampton&rsquo;s
personal attractions exceeded those of any other in the royal train.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No other youth who was present,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;was more
beautiful than this prince of Hampshire (<i>quo non formosior alter
affuit</i>), nor more distinguished in the arts of learning, although as
yet tender down scarce bloomed on his cheek.&rsquo;&nbsp; The last words
testify to Southampton&rsquo;s boyish appearance. <a
name="citation377a"></a><a href="#footnote377a"
class="citation">[377a]</a>&nbsp; Next year it was rumoured, that his
&lsquo;external grace&rsquo; was to receive signal recognition by his
admission, despite his juvenility, to the Order of the Garter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There be no Knights of the Garter new chosen as yet,&rsquo; wrote a
well-informed courtier on May 3, 1593, &lsquo;but there were four
nominated.&rsquo; <a name="citation377b"></a><a href="#footnote377b"
class="citation">[377b]</a>&nbsp; Three were eminent public servants, but
first on the list stood the name of young Southampton.&nbsp; The purpose
did not take effect, but the compliment of nomination was, at his age,
without precedent outside the circle of the Sovereign&rsquo;s
kinsmen.&nbsp; On November 17, 1595, he appeared in the lists set up in the
Queen&rsquo;s presence in honour of the <!-- page 378--><a
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>thirty-seventh
anniversary of her accession.&nbsp; The poet George Peele pictured in blank
verse the gorgeous scene, and likened the Earl of Southampton to that
ancient type of chivalry, Bevis of Southampton, so &lsquo;valiant in
arms,&rsquo; so &lsquo;gentle and debonair,&rsquo; did he appear to all
beholders. <a name="citation378"></a><a href="#footnote378"
class="citation">[378]</a></p>
<h4>Reluctance to marry.</h4>
<p>But clouds were rising on this sunlit horizon.&nbsp; Southampton, a
wealthy peer without brothers or uncles, was the only male representative
of his house.&nbsp; A lawful heir was essential to the entail of his great
possessions.&nbsp; Early marriages&mdash;child-marriages&mdash;were in
vogue in all ranks of society, and Southampton&rsquo;s mother and guardian
regarded matrimony at a tender age as especially incumbent on him in view
of his rich heritage.&nbsp; When he was seventeen Burghley accordingly
offered him a wife in the person of his granddaughter, Lady Elizabeth Vere,
eldest daughter of his daughter Anne and of the Earl of Oxford.&nbsp; The
Countess of Southampton approved the match, and told Burghley that her son
was not averse from it.&nbsp; Her wish was father to the thought.&nbsp;
Southampton declined to marry to order, and, to the confusion of his
friends, was still a bachelor when he came of age in 1594.&nbsp; Nor even
then did there seem much prospect of his changing his condition.&nbsp; He
was in some ways as young for his years in inward disposition as in outward
appearance.&nbsp; Although gentle and amiable in most relations of life, he
could be childishly self-willed and impulsive, and outbursts of anger
involved him, at Court and elsewhere, in many petty quarrels which were
with difficulty settled without bloodshed.&nbsp; Despite his rank and
wealth, he was consequently accounted by many ladies of far too uncertain a
temper to sustain marital responsibilities with credit.&nbsp; Lady Bridget
Manners, sister of his friend the Earl of Rutland, was in 1594 looking to
matrimony for means of release from the servitude of a lady-in-waiting to
the Queen.&nbsp; Her guardian suggested that Southampton or the Earl of
Bedford, who was intimate with Southampton and exactly of his age, would be
an eligible suitor.&nbsp; Lady Bridget dissented.&nbsp; Southampton and his
friend were, she objected, &lsquo;so young,&rsquo;
&lsquo;fantastical,&rsquo; and volatile (&lsquo;so easily carried
away&rsquo;), that should ill fortune <!-- page 379--><a
name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 379</span>befall her mother,
who was &lsquo;her only stay,&rsquo; she &lsquo;doubted their carriage of
themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; She spoke, she said, from observation. <a
name="citation379"></a><a href="#footnote379"
class="citation">[379]</a></p>
<h4>Intrigue with Elizabeth Vernon.</h4>
<p>In 1595, at two-and-twenty, Southampton justified Lady Bridget&rsquo;s
censure by a public proof of his fallibility.&nbsp; The fair Mistress
Vernon (first cousin of the Earl of Essex), a passionate beauty of the
Court, cast her spell on him.&nbsp; Her virtue was none too stable, and in
September the scandal spread that Southampton was courting her &lsquo;with
too much familiarity.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Marriage in 1598.</h4>
<p>The entanglement with &lsquo;his fair mistress&rsquo; opened a new
chapter in Southampton&rsquo;s career, and life&rsquo;s tempests began in
earnest.&nbsp; Either to free himself from his mistress&rsquo;s toils, or
to divert attention from his intrigue, he in 1596 withdrew from Court and
sought sterner occupation.&nbsp; Despite his mistress&rsquo;s lamentations,
which the Court gossips duly chronicled, he played a part with his friend
Essex in the military and naval expedition to Cadiz in 1596, and in that to
the Azores in 1597.&nbsp; He developed a martial ardour which brought him
renown, and Mars (his admirers said) vied with Mercury for his
allegiance.&nbsp; He travelled on the Continent, and finally, in 1598, he
accepted a subordinate place in the suite of the Queen&rsquo;s Secretary,
Sir Robert Cecil, who was going on an embassy to Paris.&nbsp; But Mistress
Vernon was still fated to be his evil genius, and Southampton learnt while
in Paris that her condition rendered marriage essential to her decaying
reputation.&nbsp; He hurried to London and, yielding his own scruples to
her entreaties, secretly made her his wife during the few days he stayed in
this country.&nbsp; The step was full of peril.&nbsp; To marry a lady of
the Court without the Queen&rsquo;s consent infringed a prerogative of the
Crown by which Elizabeth set exaggerated store.</p>
<h4>Imprisonment, 1601-3.</h4>
<p><!-- page 380--><a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
380</span>The story of Southampton&rsquo;s marriage was soon public
property.&nbsp; His wife quickly became a mother, and when he crossed the
Channel a few weeks later to revisit her he was received by pursuivants,
who had the Queen&rsquo;s orders to carry him to the Fleet prison.&nbsp;
For the time his career was ruined.&nbsp; Although he was soon released
from gaol, all avenues to the Queen&rsquo;s favour were closed to
him.&nbsp; He sought employment in the wars in Ireland, but high command
was denied him.&nbsp; Helpless and hopeless, he late in 1600 joined Essex,
another fallen favourite, in fomenting a rebellion in London, in order to
regain by force the positions each had forfeited.&nbsp; The attempt at
insurrection failed, and the conspirators stood their trial on a capital
charge of treason on February 19, 1600-1.&nbsp; Southampton was condemned
to die, but the Queen&rsquo;s Secretary pleaded with her that &lsquo;the
poor young earl, merely for the love of Essex, had been drawn into this
action,&rsquo; and his punishment was commuted to imprisonment for
life.&nbsp; Further mitigation was not to be looked for while the Queen
lived.&nbsp; But Essex, Southampton&rsquo;s friend, had been James&rsquo;s
sworn ally.&nbsp; The first act of James I as monarch of England was to set
Southampton free (April 10, 1603).&nbsp; After a confinement of more than
two years, Southampton resumed, under happier auspices, his place at
Court.</p>
<h4>Later career.&nbsp; Death on Nov. 10, 1624.</h4>
<p>Southampton&rsquo;s later career does not directly concern the student
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s biography.&nbsp; After Shakespeare had congratulated
Southampton on his liberty in his Sonnet cvii., there is no trace of
further relations between them, although there is no reason to doubt that
they remained friends to the end.&nbsp; Southampton on his release from
prison was immediately installed a Knight of the Garter, and was appointed
governor of the Isle of Wight, while an Act of Parliament relieved him of
all the disabilities incident to his conviction of treason.&nbsp; He was
thenceforth a prominent figure in Court festivities.&nbsp; He twice danced
a correnta with the Queen at the magnificent entertainment given at
Whitehall on August 19, 1604, in honour of the Constable of Castile, the
special ambassador of Spain, who had come to sign a treaty of peace between
his sovereign and James I. <a name="citation380"></a><a href="#footnote380"
class="citation">[380]</a>&nbsp; But home politics <!-- page 381--><a
name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>proved no congenial
field for the exercise of Southampton&rsquo;s energies.&nbsp; Quarrels with
fellow-courtiers continued to jeopardise his fortunes.&nbsp; With Sir
Robert Cecil, with Philip Herbert, Earl of Montgomery, and with the Duke of
Buckingham he had violent disputes.&nbsp; It was in the schemes for
colonising the New World that Southampton found an outlet for his impulsive
activity.&nbsp; He helped to equip expeditions to Virginia, and acted as
treasurer of the Virginia Company.&nbsp; The map of the country
commemorates his labours as a colonial pioneer.&nbsp; In his honour were
named Southampton Hundred, Hampton River, and Hampton Roads in
Virginia.&nbsp; Finally, in the summer of 1624, at the age of fifty-one,
Southampton, with characteristic spirit, took command of a troop of English
volunteers which was raised to aid the Elector Palatine, husband of James
I&rsquo;s daughter Elizabeth, in his struggle with the Emperor and the
Catholics of Central Europe.&nbsp; With him went his eldest son, Lord
Wriothesley.&nbsp; Both on landing in the Low Countries were attacked by
fever.&nbsp; The younger man succumbed at once.&nbsp; The Earl regained
sufficient strength to accompany his son&rsquo;s body to Bergen-op-Zoom,
but there, on November 10, he himself died of a lethargy.&nbsp; Father and
son were both buried in the chancel of the church of Titchfield, Hampshire,
on December 28.&nbsp; Southampton thus outlived Shakespeare by more than
eight years.</p>
<h3><!-- page 382--><a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
382</span>IV.&mdash;THE EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON AS A LITERARY PATRON.</h3>
<h4>Southampton&rsquo;s collection of books.</h4>
<p>Southampton&rsquo;s close relations with men of letters of his time give
powerful corroboration of the theory that he was the patron whom
Shakespeare commemorated in the sonnets.&nbsp; From earliest to latest
manhood&mdash;throughout the dissipations of Court life, amid the torments
that his intrigue cost him, in the distractions of war and travel&mdash;the
earl never ceased to cherish the passion for literature which was implanted
in him in boyhood.&nbsp; His devotion to his old college, St. John&rsquo;s,
is characteristic.&nbsp; When a new library was in course of construction
there during the closing years of his life, Southampton collected books to
the value of &pound;360 wherewith to furnish it.&nbsp; This &lsquo;monument
of love,&rsquo; as the College authorities described the benefaction, may
still be seen on the shelves of the College library.&nbsp; The gift largely
consisted of illuminated manuscripts&mdash;books of hours, legends of the
saints, and medi&aelig;val chronicles.&nbsp; Southampton caused his son to
be educated at St. John&rsquo;s, and his wife expressed to the tutors the
hope that the boy would &lsquo;imitate&rsquo; his father &lsquo;in his love
to learning and to them.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>References in his letters to poems and plays.</h4>
<p>Even the State papers and business correspondence in which
Southampton&rsquo;s career is traced are enlivened by references to his
literary interests.&nbsp; Especially refreshing are the active signs
vouchsafed there of his sympathy with the great birth of English
drama.&nbsp; It was with plays that he joined other noblemen in 1598 in
entertaining his chief, Sir Robert Cecil, on the eve of the departure for
Paris of that embassy in which Southampton served Cecil as a
secretary.&nbsp; In July following Southampton contrived to enclose in an
official despatch from Paris &lsquo;certain songs&rsquo; which he was
anxious that Sir Robert Sidney, a friend <!-- page 383--><a
name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>of literary tastes,
should share his delight in reading.&nbsp; Twelve months later, while
Southampton was in Ireland, a letter to him from the Countess attested that
current literature was an everyday topic of their private talk.&nbsp;
&lsquo;All the news I can send you,&rsquo; she wrote to her husband,
&lsquo;that I think will make you merry, is that I read in a letter from
London that Sir John Falstaff is, by his mistress Dame Pintpot, made father
of a goodly miller&rsquo;s thumb&mdash;a boy that&rsquo;s all head and very
little body; but this is a secret.&rsquo; <a name="citation383a"></a><a
href="#footnote383a" class="citation">[383a]</a>&nbsp; This cryptic
sentence proves on the part of both earl and countess familiarity with
Falstaff&rsquo;s adventures in Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Henry IV,&rsquo;
where the fat knight apostrophised Mrs. Quickly as &lsquo;good pint
pot&rsquo; (Pt. I. II. iv. 443).&nbsp; Who the acquaintances were about
whom the countess jested thus lightly does not appear, but that Sir John,
the father of &lsquo;the boy that was all head and very little body,&rsquo;
was a playful allusion to Sir John&rsquo;s creator is by no means beyond
the bounds of possibility.&nbsp; In the letters of Sir Toby Matthew, many
of which were written very early in the seventeenth century (although first
published in 1660), the sobriquet of Sir John Falstaff seems to have been
bestowed on Shakespeare: &lsquo;As that excellent author Sir John Falstaff
sayes, &ldquo;what for your businesse, news, device, foolerie, and
libertie, I never dealt better since I was a man.&rdquo;&rsquo; <a
name="citation383b"></a><a href="#footnote383b"
class="citation">[383b]</a></p>
<h4>His love of the theatre.</h4>
<p>When, after leaving Ireland, Southampton spent the autumn of 1599 in
London, it was recorded that he and his friend Lord Rutland &lsquo;come not
to Court&rsquo; but &lsquo;pass away the time merely in going to plays
every day.&rsquo; <a name="citation383c"></a><a href="#footnote383c"
class="citation">[383c]</a>&nbsp; It seems that the fascination that the
drama had for Southampton and his friends led them to exaggerate the
influence that it was capable of exerting on the emotions of the
multitude.&nbsp; Southampton and Essex in February 1601 requisitioned and
paid for the revival of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Richard II&rsquo; at the
Globe Theatre on the day preceding that fixed for their insurrection, in
the hope that the play-scene of the deposition of a king might excite the
citizens of London to countenance their rebellious design. <a
name="citation383d"></a><a href="#footnote383d"
class="citation">[383d]</a>&nbsp; Imprisonment sharpened
Southampton&rsquo;s zest for the theatre.&nbsp; <!-- page 384--><a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>Within a year of his
release from the Tower in 1603 he entertained Queen Anne of Denmark at his
house in the Strand, and Burbage and his fellow players, one of whom was
Shakespeare, were bidden to present the &lsquo;old&rsquo; play of
&lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost,&rsquo; whose &lsquo;wit and
mirth&rsquo; were calculated &lsquo;to please her Majesty
exceedingly.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Poetic adulation.&nbsp; Barnabe Barnes&rsquo;s sonnet, 1593.</h4>
<p>But these are merely accidental testimonies to Southampton&rsquo;s
literary predilections.&nbsp; It is in literature itself, not in the
prosaic records of his political or domestic life, that the amplest proofs
survive of his devotion to letters.&nbsp; From the hour that, as a handsome
and accomplished lad, he joined the Court and made London his chief home,
authors acknowledged his appreciation of literary effort of almost every
quality and form.&nbsp; He had in his Italian tutor Florio, whose circle of
acquaintance included all men of literary reputation, a mentor who allowed
no work of promise to escape his observation.&nbsp; Every note in the scale
of adulation was sounded in Southampton&rsquo;s honour in contemporary
prose and verse.&nbsp; Soon after the publication, in April 1593, of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Venus and Adonis,&rsquo; with its salutation of
Southampton, a more youthful apprentice to the poet&rsquo;s craft, Barnabe
Barnes, confided to a published sonnet of unrestrained fervour his
conviction that Southampton&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;&lsquo;those heavenly
lamps&rsquo;&mdash;were the only sources of true poetic inspiration.&nbsp;
The sonnet, which is superscribed &lsquo;to the Right Noble and Virtuous
Lord, Henry, Earl of Southampton,&rsquo; runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Receive, sweet Lord, with thy thrice sacred hand<br />
&nbsp;  (Which sacred Muses make their instrument)<br />
&nbsp;  These worthless leaves, which I to thee present,<br />
(Sprung from a rude and unmanur&egrave;d land)<br />
That with your countenance graced, they may withstand<br />
&nbsp;  Hundred-eyed Envy&rsquo;s rough encounterment,<br />
&nbsp;  Whose patronage can give encouragement<br />
To scorn back-wounding Zoilus his band.<br />
Vouchsafe, right virtuous Lord, with gracious eyes&mdash;<br />
Those heavenly lamps which give the Muses light,<br />
Which give and take in course that holy fire&mdash;<br />
To view my Muse with your judicial sight:<br />
Whom, when time shall have taught, by flight, to rise<br />
Shall to thy virtues, of much worth, aspire.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Tom Nash&rsquo;s addresses.</h4>
<p><!-- page 385--><a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
385</span>Next year a writer of greater power, Tom Nash, betrayed little
less enthusiasm when dedicating to the earl his masterly essay in romance,
&lsquo;The Life of Jack Wilton.&rsquo;&nbsp; He describes Southampton, who
was then scarcely of age, as &lsquo;a dear lover and cherisher as well of
the lovers of poets as of the poets themselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;A new
brain,&rsquo; he exclaims, &lsquo;a new wit, a new style, a new soul, will
I get me, to canonise your name to posterity, if in this my first attempt I
am not taxed of presumption.&rsquo; <a name="citation385a"></a><a
href="#footnote385a" class="citation">[385a]</a>&nbsp; Although &lsquo;Jack
Wilton&rsquo; was the first book Nash formally dedicated to Southampton, it
is probable that Nash had made an earlier bid for the earl&rsquo;s
patronage.&nbsp; In a digression at the close of his &lsquo;Pierce
Pennilesse&rsquo; he grows eloquent in praise of one whom he entitles
&lsquo;the matchless image of honour and magnificent rewarder of vertue,
Jove&rsquo;s eagle-borne Ganimede, thrice noble Amintas.&rsquo;&nbsp; In a
sonnet addressed to &lsquo;this renowned lord,&rsquo; who &lsquo;draws all
hearts to his love,&rsquo; Nash expresses regret that the great poet,
Edmund Spenser, had omitted to celebrate &lsquo;so special a pillar of
nobility&rsquo; in the series of adulatory sonnets prefixed to the
&lsquo;Faerie Queene;&rsquo; and in the last lines of his sonnet Nash
suggests that Spenser suppressed the nobleman&rsquo;s name</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because few words might not comprise thy fame. <a

</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 386--><a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
386</span>Southampton was beyond doubt the nobleman in question.&nbsp; It
is certain, too, that the Earl of Southampton was among the young men for
whom Nash, in hope of gain, as he admitted, penned &lsquo;amorous
villanellos and qui passas.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of the least reputable of
these efforts of Nash survives in an obscene love-poem entitled &lsquo;The
Choosing of Valentines,&rsquo; which may be dated in 1595.&nbsp; Not only
was this dedicated to Southampton in a prefatory sonnet, but in an
epilogue, again in the form of a sonnet, Nash addressed his young patron as
his &lsquo;friend.&rsquo; <a name="citation386"></a><a href="#footnote386"
class="citation">[386]</a></p>
<h4>Markham&rsquo;s sonnet, 1595.&nbsp; Florio&rsquo;s address, 1598.</h4>
<p><!-- page 387--><a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
387</span>Meanwhile, in 1595, the versatile Gervase Markham inscribed to
Southampton, in a sonnet, his patriotic poem on Sir Richard
Grenville&rsquo;s glorious fight off the Azores.&nbsp; Markham was not
content to acknowledge with Barnes the inspiriting force of his
patron&rsquo;s eyes, but with blasphemous temerity asserted that the
sweetness of his lips, which stilled the music of the spheres, delighted
the ear of Almighty God.&nbsp; Markham&rsquo;s sonnet runs somewhat
haltingly thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou glorious laurel of the Muses&rsquo; hill,<br />
&nbsp;  Whose eyes doth crown the most victorious pen,<br />
Bright lamp of virtue, in whose sacred skill<br />
&nbsp;  Lives all the bliss of ear-enchanting men,<br />
From graver subjects of thy grave assays,<br />
&nbsp;  Bend thy courageous thoughts unto these lines&mdash;<br />
The grave from whence my humble Muse doth raise<br />
&nbsp;  True honour&rsquo;s spirit in her rough designs&mdash;<br />
And when the stubborn stroke of my harsh song<br />
Shall seasonless glide through Almighty ears<br />
Vouchsafe to sweet it with thy bless&egrave;d tongue<br />
Whose well-tuned sound stills music in the spheres;<br />
&nbsp;  So shall my tragic lays be blest by thee<br />
&nbsp;  And from thy lips suck their eternity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently Florio, in associating the earl&rsquo;s name with his great
Italian-English dictionary&mdash;the &lsquo;Worlde of
Wordes&rsquo;&mdash;more soberly defined the earl&rsquo;s place in the
republic of letters when he wrote: &lsquo;As to me and many more the
glorious and gracious sunshine of your honour hath infused light and
life.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>The congratulations of the poets in 1603.</h4>
<p>The most notable contribution to this chorus of praise is to be found,
as I have already shown, in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; The same note of eulogy was sounded by men of
letters until Southampton&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; When he was released from
prison on James I&rsquo;s accession in April 1603, his praises in
poets&rsquo; mouths were especially abundant.&nbsp; Not only was that
grateful incident celebrated by Shakespeare in what is probably the latest
of his sonnets (No. cvii.), but Samuel Daniel and John Davies of Hereford
offered the Earl congratulation in more <!-- page 388--><a
name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>prolonged
strains.&nbsp; Daniel addressed to Southampton many lines like these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The world had never taken so full note<br />
&nbsp;  Of what thou art, hadst thou not been undone:<br />
And only thy affliction hath begot<br />
&nbsp;  More fame than thy best fortunes could have won;<br />
For ever by adversity are wrought<br />
&nbsp;  The greatest works of admiration;<br />
And all the fair examples of renown<br />
Out of distress and misery are grown . . .<br />
Only the best-compos&rsquo;d and worthiest hearts<br />
God sets to act the hard&rsquo;st and constanst&rsquo;st parts. <a
name="citation388a"></a><a href="#footnote388a"
class="citation">[388a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davies was more jubilant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now wisest men with mirth do seem stark mad,<br />
And cannot choose&mdash;their hearts are all so glad.<br />
Then let&rsquo;s be merry in our God and King,<br />
That made us merry, being ill bestead.<br />
Southampton, up thy cap to Heaven fling,<br />
And on the viol there sweet praises sing,<br />
For he is come that grace to all doth bring. <a name="citation388b"></a><a
href="#footnote388b" class="citation">[388b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many like praises, some of later date, by Henry Locke (or Lok), George
Chapman, Joshua Sylvester, Richard Brathwaite, George Wither, Sir John
Beaumont, and others could be quoted.&nbsp; Beaumont, on
Southampton&rsquo;s death, wrote an elegy which panegyrises him in the
varied capacities of warrior, councillor, courtier, father, and
husband.&nbsp; But it is as a literary patron that Beaumont insists that he
chiefly deserves remembrance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I keep that glory last which is the best,<br />
The love of learning which he oft expressed<br />
In conversation, and respect to those<br />
Who had a name in arts, in verse or prose.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Elegies on Southampton.</h4>
<p><!-- page 389--><a name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
389</span>To the same effect are some twenty poems which were published in
1624, just after Southampton&rsquo;s death, in a volume entitled
&lsquo;Teares of the Isle of Wight, shed on the Tombe of their most noble
valorous and loving Captaine and Governour, the right honorable Henrie,
Earl of Southampton.&rsquo;&nbsp; The keynote is struck in the opening
stanza of the first poem by one Francis Beale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ye famous poets of the southern isle,<br />
Strain forth the raptures of your tragic muse,<br />
And with your Laureate pens come and compile<br />
The praises due to this great Lord: peruse<br />
His globe of worth, and eke his virtues brave,<br />
Like learned Maroes at Mec&aelig;nas&rsquo; grave.</p>

390</span>V.&mdash;THE TRUE HISTORY OF THOMAS THORPE AND &lsquo;MR. W.
H.&rsquo;</h3>
<h4>The publication of the sonnets in 1609.</h4>
<p>In 1598 Francis Meres enumerated among Shakespeare&rsquo;s best known
works his &lsquo;sugar&rsquo;d sonnets among his private
friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; None of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets are known to have
been in print when Meres wrote, but they were doubtless in circulation in
manuscript.&nbsp; In 1599 two of them were printed for the first time by
the piratical publisher, William Jaggard, in the opening pages of the first
edition of &lsquo;The Passionate Pilgrim.&rsquo;&nbsp; On January 3,
1599-1600, Eleazar Edgar, a publisher of small account, obtained a license
for the publication of a work bearing the title, &lsquo;A Booke called
Amours by J. D., with certein other Sonnetes by W. S.&rsquo;&nbsp; No book
answering this description is extant.&nbsp; In any case it is doubtful if
Edgar&rsquo;s venture concerned Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is more probable that his &lsquo;W.
S.&rsquo; was William Smith, who had published a collection of sonnets
entitled &lsquo;Chloris&rsquo; in 1596. <a name="citation390"></a><a
href="#footnote390" class="citation">[390]</a>&nbsp; On May 20, 1609, a
license for the publication of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo;
was granted by the Stationers&rsquo; Company to a publisher named Thomas
Thorpe, and shortly afterwards the complete collection as they have reached
us was published by Thorpe for the first time.&nbsp; To <!-- page 391--><a
name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>the volume Thorpe
prefixed a dedication in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">to the onlie begetter
of</span><br />
<span class="smcap">these insuing sonnets</span><br />
<span class="smcap">mr. w. h., all happinesse</span><br />
<span class="smcap">and that eternitie</span><br />
<span class="smcap">promised</span><br />

<span class="smcap">setting</span><br />
<span class="smcap">forth</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">T. T.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The words are fantastically arranged.&nbsp; In ordinary grammatical
order they would run: &lsquo;The well-wishing adventurer in setting forth
[<i>i.e.</i> the publisher] T[homas] T[horpe] wisheth Mr. W. H., the only
begetter of these ensuing sonnets, all happiness and that eternity promised
by our ever-living poet.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Publishers&rsquo; dedication.</h4>
<p>Few books of the sixteenth or seventeenth century were ushered into the
world without a dedication.&nbsp; In most cases it was the work of the
author, but numerous volumes, besides Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets,&rsquo; are extant in which the publisher (and not the
author) fills the role of dedicator.&nbsp; The cause of the substitution is
not far to seek.&nbsp; The signing of the dedication was an assertion of
full and responsible ownership in the publication, and the publisher in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s lifetime was the full and responsible owner of a
publication quite as often as the author.&nbsp; The modern conception of
copyright had not yet been evolved.&nbsp; Whoever in the sixteenth or early
seventeenth century was in actual possession of a manuscript was for
practical purposes its full and responsible owner.&nbsp; Literary work
largely circulated in manuscript. <a name="citation391"></a><a
href="#footnote391" class="citation">[391]</a>&nbsp; Scriveners made a
precarious livelihood by multiplying written copies, and an enterprising
publisher had many opportunities of becoming the owner of a popular book
without the author&rsquo;s sanction or knowledge.&nbsp; When a volume in
the reign of Elizabeth or James I was published independently of the
author, the publisher exercised <!-- page 392--><a name="page392"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 392</span>unchallenged all the owner&rsquo;s rights, not
the least valued of which was that of choosing the patron of the
enterprise, and of penning the dedicatory compliment above his
signature.&nbsp; Occasionally circumstances might speciously justify the
publisher&rsquo;s appearance in the guise of a dedicator.&nbsp; In the case
of a posthumous book it sometimes happened that the author&rsquo;s friends
renounced ownership or neglected to assert it.&nbsp; In other instances,
the absence of an author from London while his work was passing through the
press might throw on the publisher the task of supplying the dedication
without exposing him to any charge of sharp practice.&nbsp; But as a rule
one of only two inferences is possible when a publisher&rsquo;s name
figured at the foot of a dedicatory epistle: either the author was ignorant
of the publisher&rsquo;s design, or he had refused to countenance it, and
was openly defied.&nbsp; In the case of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; it may safely be assumed that Shakespeare received no
notice of Thorpe&rsquo;s intention of publishing the work, and that it was
owing to the author&rsquo;s ignorance of the design that the dedication was
composed and signed by the &lsquo;well-wishing adventurer in setting
forth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But whether author or publisher chose the patron of his wares, the
choice was determined by much the same considerations.&nbsp; Self-interest
was the principle underlying transactions between literary patron and
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; Publisher, like author, commonly chose
as patron a man or woman of wealth and social influence who might be
expected to acknowledge the compliment either by pecuniary reward or by
friendly advertisement of the volume in their own social circle.&nbsp; At
times the publisher, slightly extending the field of choice, selected a
personal friend or mercantile acquaintance who had rendered him some
service in trade or private life, and was likely to appreciate such general
expressions of good will as were the accepted topic of dedications.&nbsp;
Nothing that was fantastic or mysterious entered into the Elizabethan or
the Jacobean publishers&rsquo; shrewd schemes of business, and it may be
asserted with confidence that it was under the everyday prosaic conditions
of current literary traffic that the publisher Thorpe selected &lsquo;Mr.
W. H.&rsquo; as the patron of the original edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Thorpe&rsquo;s early life.</h4>
<p><!-- page 393--><a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
393</span>A study of Thorpe&rsquo;s character and career clears the point
of doubt.&nbsp; Thorpe has been described as a native of Warwickshire,
Shakespeare&rsquo;s county, and a man eminent in his profession.&nbsp; He
was neither of these things.&nbsp; He was a native of Barnet in Middlesex,
where his father kept an inn, and he himself through thirty years&rsquo;
experience of the book trade held his own with difficulty in its humblest
ranks.&nbsp; He enjoyed the customary preliminary training. <a
name="citation393a"></a><a href="#footnote393a"
class="citation">[393a]</a>&nbsp; At midsummer 1584 he was apprenticed for
nine years to a reputable printer and stationer, Richard Watkins. <a
name="citation393b"></a><a href="#footnote393b"
class="citation">[393b]</a>&nbsp; Nearly ten years later he took up the
freedom of the Stationers&rsquo; Company, and was thereby qualified to set
up as a publisher on his own account. <a name="citation393c"></a><a
href="#footnote393c" class="citation">[393c]</a>&nbsp; He was not destitute
of a taste for literature; he knew scraps of Latin, and recognised a good
manuscript when he saw one.&nbsp; But the ranks of London publishers were
overcrowded, and such accomplishments as Thorpe possessed were poor
compensation for a lack of capital or of family connections among those
already established in the trade. <a name="citation393d"></a><a
href="#footnote393d" class="citation">[393d]</a>&nbsp; For many years he
contented himself with an obscure situation as assistant or clerk to a
stationer more favourably placed.</p>
<h4>His ownership of the manuscript of Marlowe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Lucan.&rsquo;&nbsp; His dedicatory address to Edward Blount in
1600.</h4>
<p>It was as the self-appointed procurer and owner of an unprinted
manuscript&mdash;a recognised role for novices to fill in the book trade of
the period&mdash;that Thorpe made his first distinguishable appearance on
the stage of literary history.&nbsp; In 1600 there fell into his hands in
an unexplained manner a written copy of Marlowe&rsquo;s unprinted
translation of the first book of &lsquo;Lucan.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thorpe confided
his good fortune to Edward Blount, then a stationer&rsquo;s assistant like
himself, but with better prospects.&nbsp; Blount had already achieved a
modest success in the same capacity of procurer or picker-up of neglected
&lsquo;copy.&rsquo; <a name="citation393e"></a><a href="#footnote393e"
class="citation">[393e]</a>&nbsp; In 1598 he became proprietor of
Marlowe&rsquo;s unfinished and unpublished &lsquo;Hero and Leander,&rsquo;
<!-- page 394--><a name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
394</span>and found among better-equipped friends in the trade both a
printer and a publisher for his treasure-trove.&nbsp; Blount good-naturedly
interested himself in Thorpe&rsquo;s &lsquo;find,&rsquo; and it was through
Blount&rsquo;s good offices that Peter Short undertook to print
Thorpe&rsquo;s manuscript of Marlowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lucan,&rsquo; and
Walter Burre agreed to sell it at his shop in St. Paul&rsquo;s
Churchyard.&nbsp; As owner of the manuscript Thorpe exerted the right of
choosing a patron for the venture and of supplying the dedicatory
epistle.&nbsp; The patron of his choice was his friend Blount, and he made
the dedication the vehicle of his gratitude for the assistance he had just
received.&nbsp; The style of the dedication was somewhat bombastic, but
Thorpe showed a literary sense when he designated Marlowe &lsquo;that pure
elemental wit,&rsquo; and a good deal of dry humour in offering to
&lsquo;his kind and true friend&rsquo; Blount &lsquo;some few
instructions&rsquo; whereby he might accommodate himself to the
unaccustomed <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of patron. <a name="citation394a"></a><a
href="#footnote394a" class="citation">[394a]</a>&nbsp; For the conventional
type of patron Thorpe disavowed respect.&nbsp; He preferred to place
himself under the protection of a friend in the trade whose goodwill had
already stood him in good stead, and was capable of benefiting him
hereafter.</p>
<p>This venture laid the foundation of Thorpe&rsquo;s fortunes.&nbsp; Three
years later he was able to place his own name on the title-page of two
humbler literary prizes&mdash;each an insignificant pamphlet on current
events. <a name="citation394b"></a><a href="#footnote394b"
class="citation">[394b]</a>&nbsp; Thenceforth for a dozen years his name
reappeared annually on one, two, or three volumes.&nbsp; After 1614 his
operations were few and far between, and they ceased altogether in
1624.&nbsp; He seems to have ended his days in poverty, and has been
identified with the Thomas Thorpe who <!-- page 395--><a
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>was granted an
alms-room in the hospital of Ewelme, Oxfordshire, on December 3, 1635. <a
name="citation395a"></a><a href="#footnote395a"
class="citation">[395a]</a></p>
<h4>Character of his business.</h4>
<p>Thorpe was associated with the publication of twenty-nine volumes in
all, <a name="citation395b"></a><a href="#footnote395b"
class="citation">[395b]</a> including Marlowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lucan;&rsquo;
but in almost all his operations his personal energies were confined, as in
his initial enterprise, to procuring the manuscript.&nbsp; For a short
period in 1608 he occupied a shop, The Tiger&rsquo;s Head, in St.
Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, and the fact was duly announced on the title-pages
of three publications which he issued in that year. <a
name="citation395c"></a><a href="#footnote395c"
class="citation">[395c]</a>&nbsp; But his other undertakings were described
on their title-pages as printed for him by one stationer and sold for him
by another; and when any address found mention at all, it was the
shopkeeper&rsquo;s address, and not his own.&nbsp; He never enjoyed in
permanence the profits or dignity of printing his &lsquo;copy&rsquo; at a
press of his own, or selling books on premises of his own, and he can claim
the distinction of having pursued in this homeless fashion the well-defined
profession of procurer of manuscripts for a longer period than any other
known member of the Stationers&rsquo; Company.&nbsp; Though many others
began their career in that capacity, all except Thorpe, as far as they can
be traced, either developed into printers or booksellers, or, failing in
that, betook themselves to other trades.</p>
<p>Very few of his wares does Thorpe appear to have procured direct from
the authors.&nbsp; It is true that between 1605 and 1611 there were issued
under his auspices some eight volumes of genuine literary value, including,
besides Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnets,&rsquo; three plays by Chapman,
<a name="citation395d"></a><a href="#footnote395d"
class="citation">[395d]</a> four works of Ben Jonson, and <!-- page
396--><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
396</span>Coryat&rsquo;s &lsquo;Odcombian Banquet.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the
taint of mysterious origin attached to most of his literary
properties.&nbsp; He doubtless owed them to the exchange of a few pence or
shillings with a scrivener&rsquo;s hireling; and the transaction was not
one of which the author had cognisance.</p>
<h4>Shakespeare&rsquo;s sufferings at publishers&rsquo; hands.</h4>
<p>It is quite plain that no negotiation with the author preceded the
formation of Thorpe&rsquo;s resolve to publish for the first time
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; in 1609.&nbsp; Had Shakespeare
associated himself with the enterprise, the world would fortunately have
been spared Thorpe&rsquo;s dedication to &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo;&nbsp; T.
T.&rsquo;s&rsquo; place would have been filled by &lsquo;W. S.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The whole transaction was in Thorpe&rsquo;s vein.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; had been already circulating in manuscript for eleven
years; only two had as yet been printed, and those were issued by the
pirate publisher, William Jaggard, in the fraudulently christened volume,
&lsquo;The Passionate Pilgrim, by William Shakespeare,&rsquo; in
1599.&nbsp; Shakespeare, except in the case of his two narrative poems,
showed utter indifference to all questions touching the publication of his
works.&nbsp; Of the sixteen plays of his that were published in his
lifetime, not one was printed with his sanction.&nbsp; He made no audible
protest when seven contemptible dramas in which he had no hand were
published with his name or initials on the title-page while his fame was at
its height.&nbsp; With only one publisher of his time, Richard Field, his
fellow-townsman, who was responsible for the issue of &lsquo;Venus&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Lucrece,&rsquo; is it likely that he came into personal
relations, and there is nothing to show that he maintained relations with
Field after the publication of &lsquo;Lucrece&rsquo; in 1594.</p>
<p>In fitting accord with the circumstance that the publication of the
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; was a tradesman&rsquo;s venture which ignored the
author&rsquo;s feelings and rights, Thorpe in both the entry of the book in
the &lsquo;Stationers&rsquo; Registers&rsquo; and on its title-page <!--
page 397--><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>brusquely designated it &lsquo;Shakespeares Sonnets,&rsquo;
instead of following the more urbane collocation of words invariably
adopted by living authors, viz. &lsquo;Sonnets by William
Shakespeare.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>The use of initials in dedications of Elizabethan and Jacobean
books.</h4>
<p>In framing the dedication Thorpe followed established precedent.&nbsp;
Initials run riot over Elizabethan and Jacobean books.&nbsp; Printers and
publishers, authors and contributors of prefatory commendations were all in
the habit of masking themselves behind such symbols.&nbsp; Patrons figured
under initials in dedications somewhat less frequently than other sharers
in the book&rsquo;s production.&nbsp; But the conditions determining the
employment of initials in that relation were well defined.&nbsp; The
employment of initials in a dedication was a recognised mark of a close
friendship or intimacy between patron and dedicator.&nbsp; It was a sign
that the patron&rsquo;s fame was limited to a small circle, and that the
revelation of his full name was not a matter of interest to a wide
public.&nbsp; Such are the dominant notes of almost all the extant
dedications in which the patron is addressed by his initials.&nbsp; In 1598
Samuel Rowlands addressed the dedication of his &lsquo;Betraying of
Christ&rsquo; to his &lsquo;deare affected <i>friend</i> Maister H. W.,
gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; An edition of Robert Southwell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Short
Rule of Life&rsquo; which appeared in the same year bore a dedication
addressed &lsquo;to my deare affected <i>friend</i> M. [<i>i.e.</i> Mr.] D.
S., gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; The poet Richard Barnfield also in the same
year dedicated the opening sonnet in his &lsquo;Poems in divers
Humours&rsquo; to his &lsquo;<i>friend</i> Maister R. L.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
1617 Dunstan Gale dedicated a poem, &lsquo;Pyramus and Thisbe,&rsquo; to
the &lsquo;worshipfull his verie <i>friend</i> D. [<i>i.e.</i> Dr.] B. H.
<a name="citation397"></a><a href="#footnote397"
class="citation">[397]</a></p>
<h4>Frequency of wishes for &lsquo;happiness&rsquo; and
&lsquo;eternity&rsquo; in dedicatory greetings.</h4>
<p>There was nothing exceptional in the words of greeting which Thorpe
addressed to his patron &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo;&nbsp; They <!-- page
398--><a name="page398"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 398</span>followed a
widely adopted formula.&nbsp; Dedications of the time usually consisted of
two distinct parts.&nbsp; There was a dedicatory epistle, which might touch
at any length, in either verse or prose, on the subject of the book and the
writer&rsquo;s relations with his patron.&nbsp; But there was usually, in
addition, a preliminary salutation confined to such a single sentence as
Thorpe displayed on the first page of his edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets.&nbsp; In that preliminary sentence the dedicator habitually
&lsquo;wisheth&rsquo; his patron one or more of such blessings as health,
long life, happiness, and eternity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Al perseverance with
soules happiness&rsquo; Thomas Powell &lsquo;wisheth&rsquo; the Countess of
Kildare on the first page of his &lsquo;Passionate Poet&rsquo; in
1601.&nbsp; &lsquo;All happines&rsquo; is the greeting of Thomas Watson,
the sonnetteer, to his patron, the Earl of Oxford, on the threshold of
Watson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Passionate Century of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is
hardly a book published by Robert Greene between 1580 and 1592 that does
not open with an adjuration before the dedicatory epistle in the form:
&lsquo;To --- --- Robert Greene wisheth increase of honour with the full
fruition of perfect felicity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thorpe in Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets left the salutation to stand
alone, and omitted the supplement of a dedicatory epistle; but this, too,
was not unusual.&nbsp; There exists an abundance of contemporary examples
of the dedicatory salutation without the sequel of the dedicatory
epistle.&nbsp; Edmund Spenser&rsquo;s dedication of the &lsquo;Faerie
Queene&rsquo; to Elizabeth consists solely of the salutation in the form of
an assurance that the writer &lsquo;consecrates these his labours to live
with the eternitie of her fame.&rsquo;&nbsp; Michael Drayton both in his
&lsquo;Idea, The Shepheard&rsquo;s Garland&rsquo; (1593), and in his
&lsquo;Poemes Lyrick and Pastorall&rsquo; (1609), confined his address to
his patron to a single sentence of salutation. <a name="citation398"></a><a
href="#footnote398" class="citation">[398]</a>&nbsp; Richard Brathwaite in
1611 exclusively saluted the patron of his &lsquo;Golden Fleece&rsquo; with
&lsquo;the continuance of God&rsquo;s temporall blessings in this life,
with the crowne of immortalitie in the world to come;&rsquo; while in like
manner he greeted the patron of his &lsquo;Sonnets and Madrigals&rsquo;
<!-- page 399--><a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 399</span>in
the same year with &lsquo;the prosperitie of times successe in this life,
with the reward of eternitie in the world to come.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
&lsquo;happiness&rsquo; and &lsquo;eternity,&rsquo; or an equivalent
paraphrase, that had the widest vogue among the good wishes with which the
dedicator in the early years of the seventeenth century besought his
patron&rsquo;s favour on the first page of his book.&nbsp; But Thorpe was
too self-assertive to be a slavish imitator.&nbsp; His addiction to bombast
and his elementary appreciation of literature recommended to him the
practice of incorporating in his dedicatory salutation some high-sounding
embellishments of the accepted formula suggested by his author&rsquo;s
writing. <a name="citation399a"></a><a href="#footnote399a"
class="citation">[399a]</a>&nbsp; In his dedication of the
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; to &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; he grafted on the common
formula a reference to the immortality which Shakespeare, after the habit
of contemporary sonnetteers, promised the hero of his sonnets in the pages
that succeeded.&nbsp; With characteristic magniloquence, Thorpe added the
decorative and supererogatory phrase, &lsquo;promised by our ever-living
poet,&rsquo; to the conventional dedicatory wish for his patron&rsquo;s
&lsquo;all happiness&rsquo; and &lsquo;eternitie.&rsquo; <a

<h4>Five dedications by Thorpe.</h4>
<p>Thorpe, as far as is known, penned only one dedication before that to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; His dedicatory experience
was previously limited to the inscription of Marlowe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Lucan&rsquo; in 1600 to Blount, his friend in the trade.&nbsp; Three
dedications by Thorpe survive <!-- page 400--><a name="page400"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 400</span>of a date subsequent to the issue of the
&lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; One of these is addressed to John Florio, and
the other two to the Earl of Pembroke. <a name="citation400a"></a><a
href="#footnote400a" class="citation">[400a]</a>&nbsp; But these three
dedications all prefaced volumes of translations by one John Healey, whose
manuscripts had become Thorpe&rsquo;s prey after the author had emigrated
to Virginia, where he died shortly after landing.&nbsp; Thorpe chose, he
tells us, Florio and the Earl of Pembroke as patrons of Healey&rsquo;s
unprinted manuscripts because they had been patrons of Healey before his
expatriation and death.&nbsp; There is evidence to prove that in choosing a
patron for the &lsquo;Sonnets,&rsquo; and penning a dedication for the
second time, he pursued the exact procedure that he had
followed&mdash;deliberately and for reasons that he fully stated&mdash;in
his first and only preceding dedicatory venture.&nbsp; He chose his patron
from the circle of his trade associates, and it must have been because his
patron was a personal friend that he addressed him by his initials,
&lsquo;W. H.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>&lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; signs dedication of Southwell&rsquo;s poems in
1606.</h4>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; is not the only volume of the
period in the introductory pages of which the initials &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo;
play a prominent part.&nbsp; In 1606 one who concealed himself under the
same letters performed for &lsquo;A Foure-fould Meditation&rsquo; (a
collection of pious poems which the Jesuit Robert Southwell left in
manuscript at his death) the identical service that Thorpe performed for
Marlowe&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lucan&rsquo; in 1600, and for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; in 1609.&nbsp; In 1606 Southwell&rsquo;s manuscript
fell into the hands of this &lsquo;W. H.,&rsquo; and he published it
through the agency of the printer, George Eld, and of an insignificant
bookseller, Francis Burton. <a name="citation400b"></a><a
href="#footnote400b" class="citation">[400b]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;W. H.,&rsquo;
in his capacity of owner, supplied the dedication with his own pen under
his initials.&nbsp; Of the Jesuit&rsquo;s newly recovered poems &lsquo;W.
H.&rsquo; wrote, &lsquo;Long have they lien hidden <!-- page 401--><a
name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 401</span>in obscuritie, and
haply had never scene the light, had not a meere accident conveyed them to
my hands.&nbsp; But, having seriously perused them, loath I was that any
who are religiously affected, should be deprived of so great a comfort, as
the due consideration thereof may bring unto them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;W.
H.&rsquo; chose as patron of his venture one Mathew Saunders, Esq., and to
the dedicatory epistle prefixed a conventional salutation wishing Saunders
long life and prosperity.&nbsp; The greeting was printed in large and bold
type thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the Right Worfhipfull and<br />
Vertuous Gentleman, Mathew<br />
Saunders, Efquire<br />
W.H. wifheth, with long life, a profperous<br />
achieuement of his good defires.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There follows in small type, regularly printed across the page, a
dedicatory letter&mdash;the frequent sequel of the dedicatory
salutation&mdash;in which the writer, &lsquo;W.H.,&rsquo; commends the
religious temper of &lsquo;these meditations&rsquo; and deprecates the
coldness and sterility of his own &lsquo;conceits.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
dedicator signs himself at the bottom of the page &lsquo;Your Worships
unfained affectionate, W.H.&rsquo; <a name="citation401"></a><a
href="#footnote401" class="citation">[401]</a></p>
<p>The two books&mdash;Southwell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Foure-fould
Meditation&rsquo; of 1606, and Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; of
1609&mdash;have more in common than the appearance on the preliminary pages
of the initials &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; in a prominent place, and of the common
form of dedicatory salutation.&nbsp; Both volumes, it was announced on the
title-pages, came from the same press&mdash;the press of George <!-- page
402--><a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 402</span>Eld.&nbsp;
Eld for many years co-operated with Thorpe in business.&nbsp; In 1605 he
printed for Thorpe Ben Jonson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sejanus,&rsquo; and in each of
the years 1607, 1608, 1609, and 1610 at least one of his ventures was
publicly declared to be a specimen of Eld&rsquo;s typography.&nbsp; Many of
Thorpe&rsquo;s books came forth without any mention of the printer; but
Eld&rsquo;s name figures more frequently upon them than that of any other
printer.&nbsp; Between 1605 and 1609 it is likely that Eld printed all
Thorpe&rsquo;s &lsquo;copy&rsquo; as matter of course and that he was in
constant relations with him.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; and Mr. William Hall.</h4>
<p>There is little doubt that the &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; of the Southwell
volume was Mr. William Hall, who, when he procured that manuscript for
publication, was an humble auxiliary in the publishing army.&nbsp; Hall
flits rapidly across the stage of literary history.&nbsp; He served an
apprenticeship to the printer and stationer John Allde from 1577 to 1584,
and was admitted to the freedom of the Stationers&rsquo; Company in the
latter year.&nbsp; For the long period of twenty-two years after his
release from his indentures he was connected with the trade in a dependent
capacity, doubtless as assistant to a master-stationer.&nbsp; When in 1606
the manuscript of Southwell&rsquo;s poems was conveyed to his hands and he
adopted the recognised role of procurer of their publication, he had not
set up in business for himself.&nbsp; It was only later in the same year
(1606) that he obtained the license of the Stationers&rsquo; Company to
inaugurate a press in his own name, and two years passed before he began
business.&nbsp; In 1608 he obtained for publication a theological
manuscript which appeared next year with his name on the title-page for the
first time.&nbsp; This volume constituted the earliest credential of his
independence.&nbsp; It entitled him to the prefix &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; in all
social relations.&nbsp; Between 1609 and 1614 he printed some twenty
volumes, most of them sermons and almost all devotional in tone.&nbsp; The
most important of his secular undertaking was Guillim&rsquo;s far-famed
&lsquo;Display of Heraldrie,&rsquo; a folio issued in 1610.&nbsp; In 1612
Hall printed an account of the conviction and execution of a noted
pickpocket, John Selman, who had been arrested while professionally engaged
in the Royal Chapel at Whitehall.&nbsp; On the title-page Hall gave his own
name by his initials only.&nbsp; The book was described in bold type as
&lsquo;printed by W. H.&rsquo; and as on sale at the shop of Thomas <!--
page 403--><a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 403</span>Archer
in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard.&nbsp; Hall was a careful printer with a
healthy dread of misprints, but his business dwindled after 1613, and, soon
disposing of it to one John Beale, he disappeared into private life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; are no uncommon initials, and there is more interest
attaching to the discovery of &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo;s&rsquo; position in
life and his function in relation to the scheme of the publication of the
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; than in establishing his full name.&nbsp; But there
is every probability that William Hall, the &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; of the
Southwell dedication, was one and the same person with the &lsquo;Mr. W.
H.&rsquo; of Thorpe&rsquo;s dedication of the &lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp;
No other inhabitant of London was habitually known to mask himself under
those letters.&nbsp; William Hall was the only man bearing those initials
who there is reason to suppose was on familiar terms with Thorpe. <a
name="citation403a"></a><a href="#footnote403a"
class="citation">[403a]</a>&nbsp; Both were engaged at much the same period
in London in the same occupation of procuring manuscripts for publication;
both inscribed their literary treasure-trove in the common formula to
patrons for whom they claimed no high rank or distinction, and both engaged
the same printer to print their most valuable prize.</p>
<h4>&lsquo;The onlie begetter&rsquo; means &lsquo;only
procurer&rsquo;.</h4>
<p>No condition of the problem of the identity of Thorpe&rsquo;s friend
&lsquo;Mr. W. H&rsquo; seems ignored by the adoption of the interpretation
that he was the future master-printer William Hall.&nbsp; The objection
that &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; could not have been Thorpe&rsquo;s friend in
trade, because while wishing him all happiness and eternity Thorpe dubs him
&lsquo;the onlie begetter of these insuing sonnets,&rsquo; is not
formidable.&nbsp; Thorpe rarely used words with much exactness. <a
name="citation403b"></a><a href="#footnote403b"
class="citation">[403b]</a>&nbsp; <!-- page 404--><a
name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 404</span>It is obvious that he
did not employ &lsquo;begetter&rsquo; in the ordinary sense.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Begetter,&rsquo; when literally interpreted as applied to a literary
work, means father, author, producer, and it cannot be seriously urged that
Thorpe intended to describe &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; as the author of the
&lsquo;Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Begetter&rsquo; has been used in the
figurative sense of inspirer, and it is often assumed that by &lsquo;onlie
begetter&rsquo; Thorpe meant &lsquo;sole inspirer,&rsquo; and that by the
use of those words he intended to hint at the close relations subsisting
between &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; and Shakespeare in the dramatist&rsquo;s early
life; but that interpretation presents numberless difficulties.&nbsp; It
was contrary to Thorpe&rsquo;s aims in business to invest a dedication with
any cryptic significance, and thus mystify his customers.&nbsp; Moreover,
his career and the circumstances under which he became the publisher of the
sonnets confute the assumption that he was in such relations with
Shakespeare or with Shakespeare&rsquo;s associates as would give him any
knowledge of Shakespeare&rsquo;s early career that was not public
property.&nbsp; All that Thorpe&mdash;the struggling pirate-publisher,
&lsquo;the well-wishing adventurer in setting forth&rsquo; wares
mysteriously come by&mdash;knew or probably cared to know of Shakespeare
was that he was the most popular and honoured of the literary producers of
the day.&nbsp; When Thorpe had the luck to acquire surreptitiously an
unprinted manuscript by &lsquo;our ever-living poet,&rsquo; it was not in
the great man&rsquo;s circle of friends or patrons, to which hitherto he
had had no access, that he was likely to seek his own patron.&nbsp;
Elementary considerations of prudence impelled him to publish his
treasure-trove with all expedition, and not disclose his design prematurely
to one who might possibly take steps to hinder its fulfilment.&nbsp; But
that Thorpe had no &lsquo;inspirer&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; in
his mind when he addressed himself to &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; is finally
proved by the circumstance that the only identifiable male
&lsquo;inspirer&rsquo; of the poems was the Earl of Southampton, to whom
the initials &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo; do not apply.</p>
<p>Of the figurative meanings set in Elizabethan English on the word
&lsquo;begetter,&rsquo; that of &lsquo;inspirer&rsquo; is by no means the
only one <!-- page 405--><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
405</span>or the most common.&nbsp; &lsquo;Beget&rsquo; was not
infrequently employed in the attenuated sense of &lsquo;get,&rsquo;
&lsquo;procure,&rsquo; or &lsquo;obtain,&rsquo; a sense which is easily
deducible from the original one of &lsquo;bring into being.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Hamlet, when addressing the players, bids them &lsquo;in the very whirlwind
of passion acquire and beget a temperance that may give it
smoothness.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I have some cousins german at Court,&rsquo;
wrote Dekker in 1602, in his &lsquo;Satiro-Mastix,&rsquo; &lsquo;[that]
shall beget you the reversion of the Master of the King&rsquo;s
Revels.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. W. H.,&rsquo; whom Thorpe described as
&lsquo;the onlie begetter of these insuing sonnets,&rsquo; was in all
probability the acquirer or procurer of the manuscript, who, figuratively
speaking, brought the book into being either by first placing the
manuscript in Thorpe&rsquo;s hands or by pointing out the means by which a
copy might be acquired.&nbsp; To assign such significance to the word
&lsquo;begetter&rsquo; was entirely in Thorpe&rsquo;s vein. <a
name="citation405"></a><a href="#footnote405"
class="citation">[405]</a>&nbsp; Thorpe described his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in
the piratical enterprise of the &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; as that of &lsquo;the
well-wishing adventurer in setting forth,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i> the hopeful
speculator in the scheme.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; doubtless played
the almost equally important part&mdash;one as well known then as now in
commercial operations&mdash;of the &lsquo;vendor&rsquo; of the property to
be exploited.</p>

406</span>VI.&mdash;&lsquo;MR. WILLIAM HERBERT.&rsquo;</h3>
<h4>Origin of the notion that &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;Mr.
William Herbert.&rsquo;</h4>
<p>For fully sixty years it has been very generally assumed that
Shakespeare addressed the bulk of his sonnets to the young Earl of
Pembroke.&nbsp; This theory owes its origin to a speciously lucky guess
which was first disclosed to the public in 1832, and won for a time almost
universal acceptance. <a name="citation406"></a><a href="#footnote406"
class="citation">[406]</a>&nbsp; Thorpe&rsquo;s form of address was held to
justify the mistaken inference that, whoever &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; may
have been, he and no other was the hero of the alleged story of the poems;
and the cornerstone of the Pembroke theory was the assumption that the
letters &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; in the dedication did duty for the words
&lsquo;Mr. William Herbert,&rsquo; by which name the (third) Earl of
Pembroke was represented as having been known in youth.&nbsp; The <!-- page
407--><a name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 407</span>originators
of the theory claimed to discover in the Earl of Pembroke the only young
man of rank and wealth to whom the initials &lsquo;W. H&rsquo; applied at
the needful dates.&nbsp; In thus interpreting the initials, the Pembroke
theorists made a blunder that proves on examination to be fatal to their
whole contention.</p>
<h4>The Earl of Pembroke known only as Lord Herbert in youth.</h4>
<p>The nobleman under consideration succeeded to the earldom of Pembroke on
his father&rsquo;s death on January 19, 1601 (N. S.), when he was twenty
years and nine months old, and from that date it is unquestioned that he
was always known by his lawful title.&nbsp; But it has been overlooked that
the designation &lsquo;Mr. William Herbert,&rsquo; for which the initials
&lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; have been long held to stand, could never in the
mind of Thomas Thorpe or any other contemporary have denominated the Earl
at any moment of his career.&nbsp; When he came into the world on April 9,
1580, his father had been (the second) Earl of Pembroke for ten years, and
he, as the eldest son, was from the hour of his birth known in all
relations of life&mdash;even in the baptismal entry in the parish
register&mdash;by the title of Lord Herbert, and by no other.&nbsp; During
the lifetime of his father and his own minority several references were
made to him in the extant correspondence of friends of varying degrees of
intimacy.&nbsp; He is called by them, without exception, &lsquo;my Lord
Herbert,&rsquo; &lsquo;the Lord Herbert,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Lord
Herbert.&rsquo; <a name="citation407"></a><a href="#footnote407"
class="citation">[407]</a>&nbsp; It is true that as the eldest son of an
earl he held the title by courtesy, but for all practical purposes it was
as well recognised in common speech as if he had been a peer in his own
right.&nbsp; No one nowadays would address in current parlance, or even
entertain the conception of, Viscount Cranborne, the heir of the present
Prime Minister, as &lsquo;Mr. J. C.&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mr. James
Cecil.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is no more legitimate to assert that it would have
occurred to an Elizabethan&mdash;least of all to a personal acquaintance or
to a publisher <!-- page 408--><a name="page408"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 408</span>who stood toward his patron in the relation of
a personal dependent&mdash;to describe &lsquo;young Lord Herbert,&rsquo; of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, as &lsquo;Mr. William Herbert.&rsquo;&nbsp; A
lawyer, who in the way of business might have to mention the young
lord&rsquo;s name in a legal document, would have entered it as
&lsquo;William Herbert, commonly called Lord Herbert.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
appellation &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; was not used loosely then as now, but
indicated a precise social grade.&nbsp; Thorpe&rsquo;s employment of the
prefix &lsquo;Mr.&rsquo; without qualification is in itself fatal to the
pretension that any lord, whether by right or courtesy, was intended. <a
name="citation408"></a><a href="#footnote408"
class="citation">[408]</a></p>
<h4>Thorpe&rsquo;s mode of addressing the Earl of Pembroke.</h4>
<p>Proof is at hand to establish that Thorpe was under no misapprehension
as to the proper appellation of the Earl of Pembroke, and was incapable of
venturing on the meaningless misnomer of &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Insignificant publisher though he was, and sceptical as he was of the
merits of noble patrons, he was not proof against the temptation, when an
opportunity was directly offered him, of adorning the prefatory pages of a
publication with the name of a nobleman, who enjoyed the high official
station, the literary culture, and the social influence of the third Earl
of Pembroke.&nbsp; In 1610&mdash;a year after he published the
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo;&mdash;there came into his hands the manuscripts of
John Healey, that humble literary aspirant who had a few months before
emigrated to Virginia, and had, it would seem, died there.&nbsp; Healey,
before leaving England, had secured through the good offices of John Florio
(a man of influence in both fashionable and literary circles) the patronage
of the Earl of Pembroke for a translation of Bishop Hall&rsquo;s fanciful
satire, &lsquo;Mundus alter et idem.&rsquo;&nbsp; Calling <!-- page
409--><a name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 409</span>his book
&lsquo;The Discoverie of a New World,&rsquo; Healey had prefixed to it, in
1609, an epistle inscribed in garish terms of flattery to the &lsquo;Truest
mirrour of truest honor, William Earl of Pembroke.&rsquo; <a
name="citation409"></a><a href="#footnote409"
class="citation">[409]</a>&nbsp; When Thorpe subsequently made up his mind
to publish, on his own account, other translations by the same hand, he
found it desirable to seek the same patron.&nbsp; Accordingly, in 1610, he
prefixed in his own name, to an edition of Healey&rsquo;s translation of
St. Augustine&rsquo;s &lsquo;Citie of God,&rsquo; a dedicatory address
&lsquo;to the honorablest patron of the Muses and good mindes, Lord
William, Earle of Pembroke, Knight of the Honourable Order (of the Garter),
&amp;c.&rsquo;&nbsp; In involved sentences Thorpe tells the &lsquo;right
gracious and gracefule Lord&rsquo; how the author left the work at death to
be a &lsquo;testimonie of gratitude, observance, and heart&rsquo;s honor to
your honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Wherefore,&rsquo; he explains, &lsquo;his
legacie, laide at your Honour&rsquo;s feete, is rather here delivered to
your Honour&rsquo;s humbly thrise-kissed hands by his poore delegate.&nbsp;
Your Lordship&rsquo;s true devoted, Th. Th.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again, in 1616, when Thorpe procured the issue of a second edition of
another of Healey&rsquo;s translations, &lsquo;Epictetus Manuall.&nbsp;
Cebes Table.&nbsp; Theoprastus Characters,&rsquo; he supplied more
conspicuous evidence of the servility with which he deemed it incumbent on
him to approach a potent patron.&nbsp; As this address by Thorpe to
Pembroke is difficult of access, I give it <i>in extenso</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;To the Right Honourable, William Earle of Pembroke, Lord
Chamberlaine to His Majestie, one of his most honorable Privie Counsell,
and Knight of the most noble order of the Garter, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right Honorable.&mdash;It may worthily seeme strange unto your
Lordship, out of what frenzy one of my meanenesse hath presumed to commit
this Sacriledge, in the straightnesse of your Lordship&rsquo;s leisure, to
present a peece, for matter and model so unworthy, and in this scribbling
age, wherein great persons are so pestered dayly with Dedications.&nbsp;
All I can alledge in extenuation of so many incongruities, is the bequest
of a deceased Man; who (in his lifetime) having offered some <!-- page
410--><a name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 410</span>translations
of his unto your Lordship, ever wisht if <i>these ensuing</i> were
published they might onely bee addressed unto your Lordship, as the last
Testimony of his dutifull affection (to use his own termes) <i>The true and
reall upholder of Learned endeavors</i>.&nbsp; This, therefore, beeing left
unto mee, as a Legacie unto your Lordship (pardon my presumption, great
Lord, from so meane a man to so great a person) I could not without some
impiety present it to any other; such a sad priviledge have the bequests of
the <i>dead</i>, and so obligatory they are, more than the requests of the
<i>living</i>.&nbsp; In the hope of this honourable acceptance I will ever
rest,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your lordship&rsquo;s humble
devoted,<br />
&lsquo;T. Th.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With such obeisances did publishers then habitually creep into the
presence of the nobility.&nbsp; In fact, the law which rigorously
maintained the privileges of peers left them no option.&nbsp; The alleged
erroneous form of address in the dedication of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; for Lord Herbert or the
Earl of Pembroke&mdash;would have amounted to the offence of
defamation.&nbsp; And for that misdemeanour the Star Chamber, always active
in protecting the dignity of peers, would have promptly called Thorpe to
account. <a name="citation410"></a><a href="#footnote410"
class="citation">[410]</a></p>
<p>Of the Earl of Pembroke, and of his brother the Earl of Montgomery, it
was stated a few years later, &lsquo;from just observation,&rsquo; on very
pertinent authority, that &lsquo;no men came near their lordships [in their
capacity of literary patrons], but with a kind of religious
address.&rsquo;&nbsp; These words figure in the prefatory epistle which two
actor-friends of Shakespeare addressed to the two Earls in the posthumously
issued First Folio of the dramatist&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; Thorpe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;kind of religious address&rsquo; on seeking Lord Pembroke&rsquo;s
patronage for Healey&rsquo;s books was somewhat more unctuous than was
customary or needful.&nbsp; But of erring conspicuously in an opposite
direction he may, without misgiving, be pronounced innocent.</p>
<h3><!-- page 411--><a name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
411</span>VII.&mdash;SHAKESPEARE AND THE EARL OF PEMBROKE.</h3>
<p>With the disposal of the allegation that &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo;
represented the Earl of Pembroke&rsquo;s youthful name, the whole theory of
that earl&rsquo;s identity with Shakespeare&rsquo;s friend collapses.&nbsp;
Outside Thorpe&rsquo;s dedicatory words, only two scraps of evidence with
any title to consideration have been adduced to show that Shakespeare was
at any time or in any way associated with Pembroke.</p>
<h4>Shakespeare with the acting company at Wilton in 1603.</h4>
<p>In the late autumn of 1603 James I and his Court were installed at the
Earl of Pembroke&rsquo;s house at Wilton for a period of two months, owing
to the prevalence of the plague in London.&nbsp; By order of the officers
of the royal household, the King&rsquo;s company of players, of which
Shakespeare was a member, gave a performance before the King at Wilton
House on December 2.&nbsp; The actors travelled from Mortlake for the
purpose, and were paid in the ordinary manner by the treasurer of the royal
household out of the public funds.&nbsp; There is no positive evidence that
Shakespeare attended at Wilton with the company, but assuming, as is
probable, that he did, the Earl of Pembroke can be held no more responsible
for his presence than for his repeated presence under the same conditions
at Whitehall.&nbsp; The visit of the King&rsquo;s players to Wilton in 1603
has no bearing on the Earl of Pembroke&rsquo;s alleged relations with
Shakespeare. <a name="citation411"></a><a href="#footnote411"
class="citation">[411]</a></p>
<h4>The dedication of the First Folio.</h4>
<p><!-- page 412--><a name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
412</span>The second instance of the association in the seventeenth century
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s name with Pembroke&rsquo;s tells wholly against the
conjectured intimacy.&nbsp; Seven years after the dramatist&rsquo;s death,
two of his friends and fellow-actors prepared the collective edition of his
plays known as the First Folio, and they dedicated the volume, in the
conventional language of eulogy, &lsquo;To the most noble and incomparable
paire of brethren, William Earl of Pembroke, &amp;c., Lord Chamberlaine to
the King&rsquo;s most excellent Majesty, and Philip, Earl of Montgomery,
&amp;c., Gentleman of His Majesties Bedchamber.&nbsp; Both Knights of the
most Noble Order of the Garter and our singular good Lords.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The choice of such patrons, whom, as the dedication intimated, &lsquo;no
one came near but with a kind of religious address,&rsquo; proves no
private sort of friendship between them and the dead author.&nbsp; To the
two earls in partnership nearly every work of any literary pretension was
dedicated at the period.&nbsp; Moreover, the third Earl of Pembroke was
Lord Chamberlain in 1623, and exercised supreme authority in theatrical
affairs.&nbsp; That his patronage should be sought for a collective edition
of the works of the acknowledged master of the contemporary stage was a
matter of course.&nbsp; It is only surprising that the editors should have
yielded to the passing vogue of soliciting the patronage of the Lord
Chamberlain&rsquo;s brother in conjunction with the Lord Chamberlain.</p>
<p>The sole passage in the editors&rsquo; dedication that can be held <!--
page 413--><a name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>to bear
on the question of Shakespeare&rsquo;s alleged intimacy with Pembroke is to
be found in their remarks: &lsquo;But since your lordships have beene
pleas&rsquo;d to thinke these trifles something, heretofore; and have
prosequuted both them, and their Authour living, with so much favour: we
hope that (they outliving him, and he not having the fate, common with
some, to be exequutor to his owne writings) you will use the like
indulgence toward them you have done unto their parent.&nbsp; There is a
great difference, whether any Booke choose his Patrones, or find them: This
hath done both.&nbsp; For, so much were your lordships&rsquo; likings of
the severall parts, when they were acted, as, before they were published,
the Volume ask&rsquo;d to be yours.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is nothing whatever
in these sentences that does more than justify the inference that the
brothers shared the enthusiastic esteem which James I and all the noblemen
of his Court extended to Shakespeare and his plays in the dramatist&rsquo;s
lifetime.&nbsp; Apart from his work as a dramatist, Shakespeare, in his
capacity of one of &lsquo;the King&rsquo;s servants&rsquo; or company of
players, was personally known to all the officers of the royal household
who collectively controlled theatrical representations at Court.&nbsp;
Throughout James I&rsquo;s reign his plays were repeatedly performed in the
royal presence, and when the dedicators of the First Folio, at the
conclusion of their address to Lords Pembroke and Montgomery, describe the
dramatist&rsquo;s works as &lsquo;these remaines of your <i>Servant</i>
Shakespeare,&rsquo; they make it quite plain that it was in the capacity of
&lsquo;King&rsquo;s servant&rsquo; or player that they knew him to have
been the object of their noble patrons&rsquo; favour.</p>
<h4>No suggestion in the sonnets of the youth&rsquo;s identity with
Pembroke.</h4>
<p>The sonnets offer no internal indication that the Earl of Pembroke and
Shakespeare ever saw each other.&nbsp; Nothing at all is deducible from the
vague parallelisms that have been adduced between the earl&rsquo;s
character and position in life and those with which the poet credited the
youth of the sonnets.&nbsp; It may be granted that both had a mother
(Sonnet iii.), that both enjoyed wealth and rank, that both were regarded
by admirers as cultivated, that both were self-indulgent in their relations
with women, and that both in early manhood were indisposed to marry, owing
to habits of gallantry.&nbsp; Of one alleged point of <!-- page 414--><a
name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 414</span>resemblance there is
no evidence.&nbsp; The loveliness assigned to Shakespeare&rsquo;s youth was
not, as far as we can learn, definitely set to Pembroke&rsquo;s
account.&nbsp; Francis Davison, when dedicating his &lsquo;Poetical
Rhapsody&rsquo; to the earl in 1602 in a very eulogistic sonnet, makes a
cautiously qualified reference to the attractiveness of his person in the
lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[His] outward shape, though it most lovely be,<br />
Doth in fair robes a fairer soul attire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only portraits of him that survive represent him in middle age, <a
name="citation414"></a><a href="#footnote414" class="citation">[414]</a>
and seem to confute the suggestion that he was reckoned handsome at any
time of life; at most they confirm Anthony Wood&rsquo;s description of him
as in person &lsquo;rather majestic than elegant.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the
point is not one of moment, and the argument neither gains nor loses, if we
allow that Pembroke may, at any rate in the sight of a poetical panegyrist,
have at one period reflected, like Shakespeare&rsquo;s youth, &lsquo;the
lovely April of his mother&rsquo;s prime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But when we have reckoned up the traits that can, on any showing, be
admitted to be common to both Pembroke and Shakespeare&rsquo;s alleged
friend, they all prove to be equally indistinctive.&nbsp; All could be
matched without difficulty in a score of youthful noblemen and gentlemen of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; Direct external evidence of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s friendly intercourse with one or other of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s young courtiers must be produced before the
sonnets&rsquo; general references to the youth&rsquo;s beauty and grace can
render the remotest assistance in establishing his identity.</p>
<h4>Aubrey&rsquo;s ignorance of any relation between Shakespeare and
Pembroke.</h4>
<p>Although it may be reckoned superfluous to adduce more arguments,
negative or positive, against the theory that the Earl of Pembroke was a
youthful friend of Shakespeare, it is worth noting that John Aubrey, the
Wiltshire antiquary, and the biographer of most Englishmen of distinction
of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, was zealously researching from
1650 onwards into the careers alike of Shakespeare and of various members
of the Earl of Pembroke&rsquo;s family&mdash;one of the chief in
Wiltshire.&nbsp; Aubrey rescued from oblivion many anecdotes&mdash;<!--
page 415--><a name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
415</span>scandalous and otherwise&mdash;both about the third Earl of
Pembroke and about Shakespeare.&nbsp; Of the former he wrote in his
&lsquo;Natural History of Wiltshire&rsquo; (ed. Britton, 1847), recalling
the earl&rsquo;s relations with Massinger and many other men of
letters.&nbsp; Of Shakespeare, Aubrey narrated much lively gossip in his
&lsquo;Lives of Eminent Persons.&rsquo;&nbsp; But neither in his account of
Pembroke nor in his account of Shakespeare does he give any hint that they
were at any time or in any manner acquainted or associated with one
another.&nbsp; Had close relations existed between them, it is impossible
that all trace of them would have faded from the traditions that were
current in Aubrey&rsquo;s time and were embodied in his writings. <a

416</span>VIII.&mdash;THE &lsquo;WILL&rsquo; SONNETS.</h3>
<p>No one has had the hardihood to assert that the text of the sonnets
gives internally any indication that the youth&rsquo;s name took the
hapless form of &lsquo;William Herbert;&rsquo; but many commentators argue
that in three or four sonnets Shakespeare admits in so many words that the
youth bore his own Christian name of Will, and even that the disdainful
lady had among her admirers other gentlemen entitled in familiar
intercourse to similar designation.&nbsp; These are fantastic assumptions
which rest on a misconception of Shakespeare&rsquo;s phraseology and of the
character of the conceits of the sonnets, and are solely attributable to
the fanatical anxiety of the supporters of the Pembroke theory to extort,
at all hazards, some sort of evidence in their favour from
Shakespeare&rsquo;s text. <a name="citation416"></a><a href="#footnote416"
class="citation">[416]</a></p>
<h4>Elizabethan meanings of &lsquo;will.&rsquo;</h4>
<p>In two sonnets (cxxxv.-vi.)&mdash;the most artificial and
&lsquo;conceited&rsquo; in the collection&mdash;the poet plays somewhat
enigmatically on his Christian name of &lsquo;Will,&rsquo; and a similar
pun has been doubtfully detected in sonnets cxxxiv. and cxlvii.&nbsp; The
groundwork of the pleasantry is the identity in form of the proper name
with the common noun &lsquo;will.&rsquo;&nbsp; This word connoted in
Elizabethan English a generous variety of conceptions, of most of which it
has long since been deprived.&nbsp; Then, as now, it was employed in the
general psychological sense of volition; but it was more often specifically
applied to two limited manifestations of the volition.&nbsp; It was the
commonest of synonyms alike for &lsquo;self will&rsquo; or
&lsquo;stubbornness&rsquo;&mdash;in which sense it <!-- page 417--><a
name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 417</span>still survives in
&lsquo;wilful&rsquo;&mdash;and for &lsquo;lust,&rsquo; or &lsquo;sensual
passion.&rsquo;&nbsp; It also did occasional duty for its own diminutive
&lsquo;wish,&rsquo; for &lsquo;caprice,&rsquo; for &lsquo;good-will,&rsquo;
and for &lsquo;free consent&rsquo; (as nowadays in &lsquo;willing,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;willingly&rsquo;).</p>
<h4>Shakespeare&rsquo;s uses of the word.</h4>
<p>Shakespeare constantly used &lsquo;will&rsquo; in all these
significations.&nbsp; Iago recognised its general psychological value when
he said, &lsquo;Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are
gardeners.&rsquo;&nbsp; The conduct of the &lsquo;will&rsquo; is discussed
after the manner of philosophy in &lsquo;Troilus and Cressida&rsquo; (II.
ii. 51-68).&nbsp; In another of Iago&rsquo;s sentences, &lsquo;Love is
merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will,&rsquo; light is
shed on the process by which the word came to be specifically applied to
sensual desire.&nbsp; The last is a favourite sense with Shakespeare and
his contemporaries.&nbsp; Angelo and Isabella, in &lsquo;Measure for
Measure,&rsquo; are at one in attributing their conflict to the
former&rsquo;s &lsquo;will.&rsquo;&nbsp; The self-indulgent Bertram, in
&lsquo;All&rsquo;s Well,&rsquo; &lsquo;fleshes his &ldquo;will&rdquo; in
the spoil of a gentlewoman&rsquo;s honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
&lsquo;Lear&rsquo; (IV. vi. 279) Regan&rsquo;s heartless plot to seduce her
brother-in-law is assigned to &lsquo;the undistinguished
space&rsquo;&mdash;the boundless range&mdash;&lsquo;of woman&rsquo;s
will.&rsquo;&nbsp; Similarly, Sir Philip Sidney apostrophised lust as
&lsquo;thou web of will.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thomas Lodge, in
&lsquo;Phillis&rsquo; (Sonnet xi.), warns lovers of the ruin that menaces
all who &lsquo;guide their course by will.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nicholas
Breton&rsquo;s fantastic romance of 1599, entitled &lsquo;The Will of Wit,
Wit&rsquo;s Will or Will&rsquo;s Wit, Chuse you whether,&rsquo; is
especially rich in like illustrations.&nbsp; Breton brings into marked
prominence the antithesis which was familiar in his day between
&lsquo;will&rsquo; in its sensual meaning, and &lsquo;wit,&rsquo; the
Elizabethan synonym for reason or cognition.&nbsp; &lsquo;A song between
Wit and Will&rsquo; opens thus:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Wit</i>: What art thou, Will?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Will</i>: A babe of nature&rsquo;s brood,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Wit</i>: Who was thy sire?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Will</i>: Sweet Lust, as lovers say.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Wit</i>: Thy mother who?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Will</i>: Wild lusty wanton blood.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Wit</i>: When wast thou born?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Will</i>: In merry month of May.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Wit</i>: And where brought up?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;  <i>Will</i>: In school of little skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  <i>Wit</i>: What learn&rsquo;dst thou there?&nbsp; &nbsp;
<i>Will</i>: Love is my lesson still.</p>
<p>Of the use of the word in the sense of stubbornness or self-will Roger
Ascham gives a good instance in his &lsquo;Scholemaster,&rsquo; <!-- page
418--><a name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 418</span>(1570),
where he recommends that such a vice in children as &lsquo;will,&rsquo;
which he places in the category of lying, sloth, and disobedience, should
be &lsquo;with sharp chastisement daily cut away.&rsquo; <a
name="citation418a"></a><a href="#footnote418a"
class="citation">[418a]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;A woman will have her will&rsquo;
was, among Elizabethan wags, an exceptionally popular proverbial phrase,
the point of which revolved about the equivocal meaning of the last
word.&nbsp; The phrase supplied the title of &lsquo;a pleasant
comedy,&rsquo; by William Haughton, which&mdash;from 1597
onwards&mdash;held the stage for the unusually prolonged period of forty
years.&nbsp; &lsquo;Women, because they cannot have their wills when they
dye, they will have their wills while they live,&rsquo; was a current
witticism which the barrister Manningham deemed worthy of record in his
&lsquo;Diary&rsquo; in 1602. <a name="citation418b"></a><a
href="#footnote418b" class="citation">[418b]</a></p>
<h4>Shakespeare&rsquo;s puns on the word.</h4>
<p>It was not only in the sonnets that Shakespeare&mdash;almost invariably
with a glance at its sensual significance&mdash;rang the changes on this
many-faced verbal token.&nbsp; In his earliest play, &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost&rsquo; (II. i. 97-101), after the princess has
tauntingly assured the King of Navarre that he will break his vow to avoid
women&rsquo;s society, the king replies, &lsquo;Not for the world, fair
madam, by my <i>will</i>&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> willingly).&nbsp; The princess
retorts &lsquo;Why <i>will</i> (<i>i.e.</i> sensual desire) shall break it
(<i>i.e.</i> the vow), <i>will</i> and nothing else.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
&lsquo;Much Ado&rsquo; (V. iv. 26 seq.), when Benedick, anxious to marry
Beatrice, is asked by the lady&rsquo;s uncle &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your
will?&rsquo; he playfully lingers on the word in his answer.&nbsp; As for
his &lsquo;will,&rsquo; his &lsquo;will&rsquo; is that the uncle&rsquo;s
&lsquo;goodwill may stand with his&rsquo; and Beatrice&rsquo;s
&lsquo;will&rsquo;&mdash;in other words that the uncle may consent to their
union.&nbsp; Slender and Anne Page vary the tame sport when the former
misinterprets the young lady&rsquo;s &lsquo;What is your will?&rsquo; into
an inquiry into the testamentary disposition of his property.&nbsp; To what
depth of vapidity Shakespeare and contemporary punsters could sink is
nowhere better illustrated than in the favour they bestowed on efforts to
extract amusement from the parities and disparities of form and meaning
subsisting between the words &lsquo;will&rsquo; and &lsquo;wish,&rsquo; the
latter being in vernacular use <!-- page 419--><a name="page419"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 419</span>as a diminutive of the former.&nbsp; Twice in
the &lsquo;Two Gentlemen of Verona&rsquo; (I. iii. 63 and IV. ii. 96)
Shakespeare almost strives to invest with the flavour of epigram the
unpretending announcement that one interlocutor&rsquo;s &lsquo;wish&rsquo;
is in harmony with another interlocutor&rsquo;s &lsquo;will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is in this vein of pleasantry&mdash;&lsquo;will&rsquo; and
&lsquo;wish&rsquo; are identically contrasted in Sonnet cxxxv.&mdash;that
Shakespeare, to the confusion of modern readers, makes play with the word
&lsquo;will&rsquo; in the sonnets, and especially in the two sonnets
(cxxxv.-vi.) which alone speciously justify the delusion that the lady is
courted by two, or more than two, lovers of the name of Will.</p>
<h4>Arbitrary and irregular use of italics by Elizabethan and Jacobean
printers.</h4>
<p>One of the chief arguments advanced in favour of this interpretation is
that the word &lsquo;will&rsquo; in these sonnets is frequently italicised
in the original edition.&nbsp; But this has little or no bearing on the
argument.&nbsp; The corrector of the press recognised that Sonnets cxxxv.
and cxxxvi. largely turned upon a simple pun between the writer&rsquo;s
name of &lsquo;Will&rsquo; and the lady&rsquo;s &lsquo;will.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That fact, and no other, he indicated very roughly by occasionally
italicising the crucial word.&nbsp; Typography at the time followed no
firmly fixed rules, and, although &lsquo;will&rsquo; figures in a more or
less punning sense nineteen times in these sonnets, the printer bestowed on
the word the distinction of italics in only ten instances, and those were
selected arbitrarily.&nbsp; The italics indicate the obvious equivoque, and
indicate it imperfectly.&nbsp; That is the utmost that can be laid to their
credit.&nbsp; They give no hint of the far more complicated punning that is
alleged by those who believe that &lsquo;Will&rsquo; is used now as the
name of the writer, and now as that of one or more of the rival
suitors.&nbsp; In each of the two remaining sonnets that have been forced
into the service of the theory, Nos. cxxxiv. and cxliii.,
&lsquo;will&rsquo; occurs once only; it alone is italicised in the second
sonnet in the original edition, and there, in my opinion, arbitrarily and
without just cause. <a name="citation419"></a><a href="#footnote419"
class="citation">[419]</a></p>
<h4>The conceits of sonnets cxxxv-vi. interpreted.</h4>
<p><!-- page 420--><a name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
420</span>The general intention of the complex conceits of Sonnets cxxxv.
and cxxxvi. becomes obvious when we bear in mind that in them Shakespeare
exploits to the uttermost the verbal coincidences which are inherent in the
Elizabethan word &lsquo;will.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Will&rsquo; is the
Christian name of the enslaved writer; &lsquo;will&rsquo; is the sentiment
with which the lady inspires her worshippers; and &lsquo;will&rsquo;
designates stubbornness as well as sensual desire.&nbsp; These two
characteristics, according to the poet&rsquo;s reiterated testimony, are
the distinguishing marks of the lady&rsquo;s disposition.&nbsp; He often
dwells elsewhere on her &lsquo;proud heart&rsquo; or &lsquo;foul
pride,&rsquo; and her sensuality or &lsquo;foul faults.&rsquo;&nbsp; These
are her &lsquo;wills,&rsquo; and they make up her being.&nbsp; In crediting
the lady with such constitution Shakespeare was not recording any definite
observation or experience of his own, but was following, as was his custom,
the conventional descriptions of the disdainful mistress common to all
contemporary collections of sonnets.&nbsp; Barnabe Barnes asks the lady
celebrated in his sonnets, from whose &lsquo;proud disdainfulness&rsquo; he
suffered,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why dost thou my delights delay,<br />
And with thy cross unkindness kills (<i>sic</i>)<br />
Mine heart, bound martyr to thy wills?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barnes answers his question in the next lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But women will have their own wills,<br />
Since what she lists her heart fulfils. <a name="citation420"></a><a
href="#footnote420" class="citation">[420]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar passages abound in Elizabethan sonnets, but certain verbal
similarities give good ground for regarding Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&lsquo;will&rsquo; sonnets as deliberate adaptations&mdash;doubtless with
satiric purpose&mdash;of Barnes&rsquo;s stereotyped reflections on
women&rsquo;s obduracy.&nbsp; The form and the constant repetition of the
word &lsquo;will&rsquo; in these two sonnets of Shakespeare also seem to
imitate derisively the same rival&rsquo;s Sonnets lxxii. and lxxiii. in
which Barnes puts the words &lsquo;grace&rsquo; and &lsquo;graces&rsquo;
through <!-- page 421--><a name="page421"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
421</span>much the same evolutions as Shakespeare puts the words
&lsquo;will&rsquo; and &lsquo;wills&rsquo; in the Sonnets cxxxv. and
cxxxvi. <a name="citation421a"></a><a href="#footnote421a"
class="citation">[421a]</a></p>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sonnet&rsquo; cxxxv. runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,<br />
And will to boot, and will in over-plus;<br />
More than enough am I that vex thee still,<br />
To thy sweet will making addition thus.<br />
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious, <br />
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?<br />
Shall will in others seem right gracious,<br />
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?<br />
The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,<br />
And in abundance addeth to his store;<br />
So thou, being rich in will, add to thy will<br />
One will of mine, to make thy large will more.<br />
&nbsp;  Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill;<br />
&nbsp;  Think all but one, and me in that one&mdash;Will.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Sonnet cxxxv.</h4>
<p>In the opening words, &lsquo;Whoever hath her wish,&rsquo; the poet
prepares the reader for the punning encounter by a slight variation on the
current catch-phrase &lsquo;A woman will have her will.&rsquo;&nbsp; At the
next moment we are in the thick of the wordy fray.&nbsp; The lady has not
only her lover named Will, but untold stores of &lsquo;will&rsquo;&mdash;in
the sense alike of stubbornness and of lust&mdash;to which it seems
supererogatory to make addition. <a name="citation421c"></a><a
href="#footnote421c" class="citation">[421c]</a>&nbsp; To the lady&rsquo;s
&lsquo;over-plus&rsquo; of &lsquo;will&rsquo; is punningly attributed her
defiance of the &lsquo;will&rsquo; of her suitor Will to enjoy her
favours.&nbsp; At the same time &lsquo;will&rsquo; in others <!-- page
422--><a name="page422"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 422</span>proves to
her &lsquo;right gracious,&rsquo; <a name="citation422a"></a><a
href="#footnote422a" class="citation">[422a]</a> although in him it is
unacceptable.&nbsp; All this, the poet hazily argues, should be otherwise;
for as the sea, although rich in water, does not refuse the falling rain,
but freely adds it to its abundant store, so she, &lsquo;rich in
will,&rsquo; should accept her lover Will&rsquo;s &lsquo;will&rsquo; and
&lsquo;make her large will more.&rsquo;&nbsp; The poet sums up his ambition
in the final couplet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill;<br />
Think all but one, and me in that one&mdash;Will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is as much as to say, &lsquo;Let not my mistress in her unkindness
kill any of her fair-spoken adorers.&nbsp; Rather let her think all who
beseech her favours incorporate in one alone of her lovers&mdash;and that
one the writer whose name of &ldquo;Will&rdquo; is a synonym for the
passions that dominate her.&rsquo;&nbsp; The thought is wiredrawn to
inanity, but the words make it perfectly clear that the poet was the only
one of the lady&rsquo;s lovers&mdash;to the definite exclusion of all
others&mdash;whose name justified the quibbling pretence of identity with
the &lsquo;will&rsquo; which controls her being.</p>
<h4>Sonnet cxxxvi.</h4>
<p>The same equivocating conceit of the poet Will&rsquo;s title to identity
with the lady&rsquo;s &lsquo;will&rsquo; in all senses is pursued in Sonnet
cxxxvi.&nbsp; The sonnet opens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If thy soul check thee that I come so near,<br />
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy will, <a name="citation422b"></a><a
href="#footnote422b" class="citation">[422b]</a><br />
And will thy soul knows is admitted there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Shakespeare adapts to his punning purpose the familiar philosophic
commonplace respecting the soul&rsquo;s domination by &lsquo;will&rsquo; or
volition, which was more clearly <!-- page 423--><a
name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 423</span>expressed by his
contemporary, Sir John Davies, in the philosophic poem, &lsquo;Nosce
Teipsum:&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will holds the royal sceptre in the soul,<br />
And on the passions of the heart doth reign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether Shakespeare&rsquo;s lines be considered with their context or
without it, the tenor of their thought and language positively refutes the
commentators&rsquo; notion that the &lsquo;will&rsquo; admitted to the
lady&rsquo;s soul is a rival lover named Will.&nbsp; The succeeding lines
run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus far for love, my love-suit, sweet, fulfil. <a
name="citation423a"></a><a href="#footnote423a"
class="citation">[423a]</a><br />
Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love;<br />
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.<br />
In things of great receipt with ease we prove<br />
Among a number one is reckon&rsquo;d none:<br />
Then in the number let me pass untold,<br />
Though in thy stores&rsquo; account, I one must be;<br />
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold<br />
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the poet Will continues to claim, in punning right of his Christian
name, a place, however small and inconspicuous, among the
&lsquo;wills,&rsquo; the varied forms of will (<i>i.e.</i> lust,
stubbornness, and willingness to accept others&rsquo; attentions), which
are the constituent elements of the lady&rsquo;s being.&nbsp; The plural
&lsquo;wills&rsquo; is twice used in identical sense by Barnabe Barnes in
the lines already quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mine heart, bound martyr to thy <i>wills</i>.<br />
But women will have their own <i>wills</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Impulsively Shakespeare brings his fantastic pretension to a somewhat
more practical issue in the concluding apostrophe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make but my name thy love, and love that still,<br />
And then thou lovest me&mdash;for my name is Will. <a
name="citation423b"></a><a href="#footnote423b"
class="citation">[423b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 424--><a name="page424"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
424</span>That is equivalent to saying &lsquo;Make
&ldquo;will&rdquo;&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> that which is yourself) &lsquo;your
love, and then you love me, because Will is my name.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
couplet proves even more convincingly than the one which clinches the
preceding sonnet that none of the rivals whom the poet sought to displace
in the lady&rsquo;s affections could by any chance have been, like himself,
called Will.&nbsp; The writer could not appeal to a mistress to concentrate
her love on his name of Will, because it was the emphatic sign of identity
between her being and him, if that name were common to him and one or more
rivals, and lacked exclusive reference to himself.</p>
<p>Loosely as Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets were constructed, the couplet at
the conclusion of each poem invariably summarises the general intention of
the preceding twelve lines.&nbsp; The concluding couplets of these two
sonnets cxxxv.-vi., in which Shakespeare has been alleged to acknowledge a
rival of his own name in his suit for a lady&rsquo;s favour, are
consequently the touchstone by which the theory of &lsquo;more Wills than
one&rsquo; must be tested.&nbsp; As we have just seen, the situation is
summarily embodied in the first couplet thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill;<br />
Think all but one, and me in that one&mdash;Will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is re-embodied in the second couplet thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make but my name thy love, and love that still,<br />
And then thou lovest me&mdash;for my name is Will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole significance of both couplets resides in the twice-repeated
fact that one, and only one, of the lady&rsquo;s lovers is named Will, and
that that one is the writer.&nbsp; To assume that the poet had a rival of
his own name is to denude both couplets of all point.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Will,&rsquo; we have learned from the earlier lines of both sonnets,
is the lady&rsquo;s ruling passion.&nbsp; Punning mock-logic brings the
poet in either sonnet to the ultimate conclusion that one of her lovers
may, above all others, reasonably claim her love on the ground that his
name of Will is the name of her ruling passion.&nbsp; Thus his pretension
to her affections rests, he punningly assures her, on a strictly logical
basis.</p>
<h4>Sonnet cxxxiv.&nbsp; Meaning of Sonnet cxliii.</h4>
<p><!-- page 425--><a name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
425</span>Unreasonable as any other interpretation of these sonnets
(cxxxv.-vi.) seems to be, I believe it far more fatuous to seek in the
single and isolated use of the word &lsquo;will&rsquo; in each of the
sonnets cxxxiv. and cxliii. any confirmation of the theory of a rival
suitor named Will.</p>
<p>Sonnet cxxxiv. runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So now I have confess&rsquo;d that he is thine,<br />
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will. <a name="citation425"></a><a
href="#footnote425" class="citation">[425]</a><br />
Myself I&rsquo;ll forfeit, so that other mine<br />
Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still.<br />
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,<br />
For thou art covetous and he is kind.<br />
He learn&rsquo;d but surety-like to write for me,<br />
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.<br />
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,<br />
Thou usurer, that putt&rsquo;st forth all to use,<br />
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;<br />
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.<br />
&nbsp;  Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me;<br />
&nbsp;  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the poet describes himself as &lsquo;mortgaged to the lady&rsquo;s
will&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> to her personality, in which &lsquo;will,&rsquo;
in the double sense of stubbornness and sensual passion, is the strongest
element).&nbsp; He deplores that the lady has captivated not merely
himself, but also his friend, who made vicarious advances to her.</p>
<p>Sonnet cxliii. runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lo, as a careful housewife runs to catch<br />
One of her feathered creatures broke away,<br />
Sets down her babe, and makes all swift despatch<br />
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay;<br />
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,<br />
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent<br />
To follow that which flies before her face,<br />
Not prizing her poor infant&rsquo;s discontent:<br />
<!-- page 426--><a name="page426"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 426</span>So
runn&rsquo;st thou after that which flies from thee,<br />
Whilst I, thy babe, chase thee afar behind;<br />
But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me,<br />
And play the mother&rsquo;s part, kiss me, be kind:<br />
&nbsp;  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy will, <a
name="citation426"></a><a href="#footnote426" class="citation">[426]</a><br
/>
&nbsp;  If thou turn back and my loud crying still.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this sonnet&mdash;which presents a very clear-cut picture, although
its moral is somewhat equivocal&mdash;the poet represents the lady as a
country housewife and himself as her babe; while an acquaintance, who
attracts the lady but is not attracted by her, is figured as a
&lsquo;feathered creature&rsquo; in the housewife&rsquo;s
poultry-yard.&nbsp; The fowl takes to flight; the housewife sets down her
infant and pursues &lsquo;the thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; The poet, believing
apparently that he has little to fear from the harmless creature, lightly
makes play with the current catch-phrase (&lsquo;a woman will have her
will&rsquo;), and amiably wishes his mistress success in her chase, on
condition that, having recaptured the truant bird, she turn back and treat
him, her babe, with kindness.&nbsp; In praying that the lady may have her
&lsquo;will&rsquo; the poet is clearly appropriating the current
catch-phrase, and no pun on a man&rsquo;s name of &lsquo;Will&rsquo; can be
fairly wrested from the context.</p>

427</span>IX.&mdash;THE VOGUE OF THE ELIZABETHAN SONNET, 1591-1597.</h3>
<p>The sonnetteering vogue, as I have already pointed out, <a
name="citation427a"></a><a href="#footnote427a" class="citation">[427a]</a>
reached its full height between 1591 and 1597, and when at its briskest in
1594 it drew Shakespeare into its current.&nbsp; An enumeration of volumes
containing sonnet-sequences or detached sonnets that were in circulation
during the period best illustrates the overwhelming force of the
sonnetteering rage of those years, and, with that end in view, I give here
a bibliographical account, with a few critical notes, of the chief efforts
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s rival sonnetteers. <a name="citation427b"></a><a
href="#footnote427b" class="citation">[427b]</a></p>
<h4>Wyatt&rsquo;s and Surrey&rsquo;s Sonnets, published in 1557.&nbsp;
Watson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Centurie of Love,&rsquo; 1582.</h4>
<p>The earliest collections of sonnets to be published in England were
those by the Earl of Surrey and Sir Thomas Wyatt, which first appeared in
the publisher Tottel&rsquo;s poetical miscellany called &lsquo;Songes and
Sonnetes&rsquo; in 1557.&nbsp; This volume included sixteen sonnets by
Surrey and twenty by Wyatt.&nbsp; Many of them were translated directly
from Petrarch, and most of them treated conventionally of the torments of
an unrequited love.&nbsp; Surrey included, however, three sonnets on the
death of his friend <!-- page 428--><a name="page428"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 428</span>Wyatt, and a fourth on the death of one Clere,
a faithful follower.&nbsp; Tottel&rsquo;s volume was seven times reprinted
by 1587.&nbsp; But no sustained endeavour was made to emulate the example
of Surrey and Wyatt till Thomas Watson about 1580 circulated in manuscript
his &lsquo;Booke of Passionate Sonnetes,&rsquo; which he wrote for his
patron, the Earl of Oxford.&nbsp; The volume was printed in 1582, under the
title of
&lsquo;&#904;&Kappa;&Alpha;&Tau;&Omicron;&Mu;&Pi;&Alpha;&Theta;&Iota;&Alpha;,
or Passionate Centurie of Loue.&nbsp; Divided into two parts: whereof the
first expresseth the Authours sufferance on Loue: the latter his long
farewell to Loue and all his tyrannie.&nbsp; Composed by Thomas Watson, and
published at the request of certaine Gentlemen his very
frendes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Watson&rsquo;s work, which he called &lsquo;a
toy,&rsquo; is a curious literary mosaic.&nbsp; He supplied to each poem a
prose commentary, in which he not only admitted that every conceit was
borrowed, but quoted chapter and verse for its origin from classical
literature or from the work of French or Italian sonnetteers. <a
name="citation428a"></a><a href="#footnote428a"
class="citation">[428a]</a>&nbsp; Two regular quatorzains are prefixed, but
to each of the &lsquo;passions&rsquo; there is appended a four-line stanza
which gives each poem eighteen instead of the regular fourteen lines.&nbsp;
Watson&rsquo;s efforts were so well received, however, that he applied
himself to the composition of a second series of sonnets in strict
metre.&nbsp; This collection, entitled &lsquo;The Teares of Fancie,&rsquo;
only circulated in manuscript in his lifetime. <a
name="citation428b"></a><a href="#footnote428b"
class="citation">[428b]</a></p>
<h4>Sidney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Astrophel and Stella,&rsquo; 1591.</h4>
<p>Meanwhile a greater poet, Sir Philip Sidney, who died in 1586, had
written and circulated among his friends a more ambitious collection of a
hundred and eight sonnets.&nbsp; Most of Sidney&rsquo;s sonnets were
addressed by him under the name of Astrophel to a beautiful woman
poetically designated Stella.&nbsp; Sidney had in real life courted
assiduously the favour of a married lady, Penelope, Lady Rich, and a few of
the sonnets are commonly held to reflect the heat of passion which the
genuine intrigue developed.&nbsp; But Petrarch, Ronsard, and Desportes
inspired the majority of Sidney&rsquo;s efforts, and his addresses to
abstractions like sleep, the moon, his muse, grief, or lust, are almost
verbatim translations from the French.&nbsp; Sidney&rsquo;s sonnets were
first published surreptitiously, <!-- page 429--><a
name="page429"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 429</span>under the title of
&lsquo;Astrophel and Stella,&rsquo; by a publishing adventurer named Thomas
Newman, and in his first issue Newman added an appendix of &lsquo;sundry
other rare sonnets by divers noblemen and gentlemen.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Twenty-eight sonnets by Daniel were printed in the appendix anonymously and
without the author&rsquo;s knowledge.&nbsp; Two other editions of
Sidney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Astrophel and Stella&rsquo; without the appendix were
issued in the same year.&nbsp; Eight other of Sidney&rsquo;s sonnets, which
still circulated only in manuscript, were first printed anonymously in 1594
with the sonnets of Henry Constable, and these were appended with some
additions to the authentic edition of Sidney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Arcadia&rsquo;
and other works that appeared in 1598.&nbsp; Sidney enjoyed in the decade
that followed his death the reputation of a demi-god, and the wide
dissemination in print of his numerous sonnets in 1591 spurred nearly every
living poet in England to emulate his achievement. <a
name="citation429a"></a><a href="#footnote429a"
class="citation">[429a]</a></p>
<p>In order to facilitate a comparison of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets with
those of his contemporaries it will be best to classify the sonnetteering
efforts that immediately succeeded Sidney&rsquo;s under the three headings
of</p>
<p>(1) sonnets of more or less feigned love, addressed to a more or less
fictitious mistress;</p>
<p>(2) sonnets of adulation, addressed to patrons; and</p>
<p>(3) sonnets invoking metaphysical abstractions or treating impersonally
of religion or philosophy. <a name="citation429b"></a><a
href="#footnote429b" class="citation">[429b]</a></p>
<h4>(1)&nbsp; Collected sonnets of feigned love.&nbsp; Daniel&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Delia,&rsquo; 1592.</h4>
<p>In February 1592 Samuel Daniel published a collection of fifty-five
sonnets, with a dedicatory sonnet addressed to his patroness,
Sidney&rsquo;s sister, the Countess of Pembroke.&nbsp; As in many French
volumes, the collection concluded with an &lsquo;ode.&rsquo; <a
name="citation429c"></a><a href="#footnote429c"
class="citation">[429c]</a>&nbsp; At every point Daniel <!-- page 430--><a
name="page430"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 430</span>betrayed his
indebtedness to French sonnetteers, even when apologising for his
inferiority to Petrarch (No. xxxviii.)&nbsp; His title he borrowed from the
collection of Maurice S&egrave;ve, whose assemblage of dixains called
&lsquo;D&eacute;lie, objet de plus haute vertu&rsquo; (Lyon, 1544), was the
pattern of all sonnet-sequences on love, and was a constant theme of
commendation among the later French sonnetteers.&nbsp; But it is to
Desportes that Daniel owes most, and his methods of handling his material
may be judged by a comparison of his Sonnet xxvi. with Sonnet lxiii. in
Desportes&rsquo; collection, &lsquo;Cleonice: Dernieres Amours,&rsquo;
which was issued at Paris in 1575.</p>
<p>Desportes&rsquo; sonnet runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Je verray par les ans vengeurs de mon martyre<br />
&nbsp;  Que l&rsquo;or de vos cheveux argent&eacute; deviendra,<br />
&nbsp;  Que de vos deux soleils la splendeur s&rsquo;esteindra,<br />
Et qu&rsquo;il faudra qu&rsquo;Amour tout confus s&rsquo;en retire.<br />
La beaut&eacute; qui si douce &agrave; present vous inspire,<br />
&nbsp;  Cedant aux lois du Temps ses faveurs reprendra,<br />
&nbsp;  L&rsquo;hiver de vostre teint les fleurettes perdra,<br />
Et ne laissera rien des thresors que i&rsquo;admire.<br />
Cest orgueil desdaigneux qui vous fait ne m&rsquo;aimer,<br />
En regret et chagrin se verra transformer,<br />
Avec le changement d&rsquo;une image si belle:<br />
&nbsp;  Et peut estre qu&rsquo;alors vous n&rsquo;aurez desplaisir<br />
&nbsp;  De revivre en mes vers chauds d&rsquo;amoureux desir,<br />
Ainsi que le Phenix au feu se renouvelle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is Daniel&rsquo;s version, which he sent forth as an original
production:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I once may see, when years may wreck my wrong,<br />
&nbsp;  And golden hairs may change to silver wire;<br />
&nbsp;  And those bright rays (that kindle all this fire)<br />
Shall fail in force, their power not so strong,<br />
Her beauty, now the burden of my song,<br />
&nbsp;  Whose glorious blaze the world&rsquo;s eye doth admire,<br />
&nbsp;  Must yield her praise to tyrant Time&rsquo;s desire;<br />
Then fades the flower, which fed her pride so long,<br />
When if she grieve to gaze her in her glass,<br />
&nbsp;  Which then presents her winter-withered hue:<br />
Go you my verse! go tell her what she was!<br />
&nbsp;  For what she was, she best may find in you.<br />
Your fiery heat lets not her glory pass,<br />
&nbsp;  But Ph&oelig;nix-like to make her live anew.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 431--><a name="page431"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
431</span>In Daniel&rsquo;s beautiful sonnet (xlix.) beginning,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night,<br />
Brother to Death, in silent darkness born,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he has borrowed much from De Ba&iuml;f and Pierre de Brach, sonnetteers
with whom it was a convention to invocate &lsquo;O Sommeil
chasse-soin.&rsquo;&nbsp; But again he chiefly relies on Desportes, whose
words he adapts with very slight variations.&nbsp; Sonnet lxxiii. of
Desportes&rsquo; &lsquo;Amours d&rsquo;Hippolyte&rsquo; opens thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sommeil, paisible fils de la Nuict solitaire . . .<br />
O fr&egrave;re de la Mort, que tu m&rsquo;es ennemi!</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Fame of Daniel&rsquo;s sonnets.</h4>
<p>Daniel&rsquo;s sonnets were enthusiastically received.&nbsp; With some
additions they were republished in 1594 with his narrative poem, &lsquo;The
Complaint of Rosamund.&rsquo;&nbsp; The volume was called &lsquo;Delia and
Rosamund Augmented.&rsquo;&nbsp; Spenser, in his &lsquo;Colin Clouts come
Home againe,&rsquo; lauded the &lsquo;well-tuned song&rsquo; of
Daniel&rsquo;s sonnets, and Shakespeare has some claim to be classed among
Daniel&rsquo;s many sonnetteering disciples.&nbsp; The anonymous author of
&lsquo;Zepheria&rsquo; (1594) declared that the &lsquo;sweet tuned
accents&rsquo; of &lsquo;Delian sonnetry&rsquo; rang throughout England;
while Bartholomew Griffin, in his &lsquo;Fidessa&rsquo; (1596), openly
plagiarised Daniel, invoking in his Sonnet xv. &lsquo;Care-charmer Sleep, .
. . brother of quiet Death.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Constable&rsquo;s &lsquo;Diana,&rsquo; 1592.</h4>
<p>In September of the same year (1592) that saw the first complete version
of Daniel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Delia,&rsquo; Henry Constable published
&lsquo;Diana: the Praises of his Mistres in certaine sweete
Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; Like the title, the general tone was drawn from
Desportes&rsquo; &lsquo;Amours de Diane.&rsquo;&nbsp; Twenty-one poems were
included, all in the French vein.&nbsp; The collection was reissued, with
very numerous additions, in 1594 under the title &lsquo;Diana; or, The
excellent conceitful Sonnets of H. C.&nbsp; Augmented with divers
Quatorzains of honourable and learned personages.&rsquo;&nbsp; This volume
is a typical venture of the booksellers. <a name="citation431"></a><a
href="#footnote431" class="citation">[431]</a>&nbsp; The printer, James
Roberts, and the publisher, Richard Smith, supplied dedications
respectively to the reader and to Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
ladies-in-waiting.&nbsp; They had swept together sonnets in manuscript from
all quarters and presented their <!-- page 432--><a
name="page432"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 432</span>customers with a
disordered miscellany of what they called &lsquo;orphan poems.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Besides the twenty sonnets by Constable, eight were claimed for Sir Philip
Sidney, and the remaining forty-seven are by various hands which have not
as yet been identified.</p>
<h4>Barnes&rsquo; sonnets, 1593.</h4>
<p>In 1593 the legion of sonnetteers received notable reinforcements.&nbsp;
In May came out Barnabe Barnes&rsquo;s interesting volume,
&lsquo;Parthenophil and Parthenophe: Sonnets, Madrigals, Elegies, and
Odes.&nbsp; To the right noble and virtuous gentleman, M. William Percy,
Esq., his dearest friend.&rsquo; <a name="citation432a"></a><a
href="#footnote432a" class="citation">[432a]</a>&nbsp; The contents of the
volume and their arrangement closely resemble the sonnet-collections of
Petrarch or the &lsquo;Amours&rsquo; of Ronsard.&nbsp; There are a hundred
and five sonnets altogether, interspersed with twenty-six madrigals, five
sestines, twenty-one elegies, three &lsquo;canzons,&rsquo; and twenty
&lsquo;odes,&rsquo; one in sonnet form.&nbsp; There is, moreover, included
what purports to be a translation of &lsquo;Moschus&rsquo; first eidillion
describing love,&rsquo; but is clearly a rendering of a French poem by
Amadis Jamin, entitled &lsquo;Amour Fuitif, du grec de Moschus,&rsquo; in
his &lsquo;&OElig;uvres Po&eacute;tiques,&rsquo; Paris, 1579. <a
name="citation432b"></a><a href="#footnote432b"
class="citation">[432b]</a>&nbsp; At the end of Barnes&rsquo;s volume there
also figure six dedicatory sonnets.&nbsp; In Sonnet xcv. Barnes pays a
compliment to Sir Philip Sidney, &lsquo;the Arcadian shepherd,
Astrophel,&rsquo; but he did not draw so largely on Sidney&rsquo;s work as
on that of Ronsard, Desportes, De Ba&iuml;f, and Du Bellay.&nbsp; Legal
metaphors abound in Barnes&rsquo;s poems, but amid many crudities, he
reaches a high level of beauty in Sonnet lxvi., which runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ah, sweet Content! where is thy mild abode?<br />
&nbsp;  Is it with shepherds, and light-hearted swains,<br />
&nbsp;  Which sing upon the downs, and pipe abroad,<br />
&nbsp;  Tending their flocks and cattle on the plains?<br />
Ah, sweet Content! where dost thou safely rest<br />
&nbsp;  In Heaven, with Angels? which the praises sing<br />
&nbsp;  Of Him that made, and rules at His behest,<br />
&nbsp;  The minds and hearts of every living thing.<br />
<!-- page 433--><a name="page433"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
433</span>Ah, sweet Content! where doth thine harbour hold?<br />
&nbsp;  Is it in churches, with religious men,<br />
&nbsp;  Which please the gods with prayers manifold;<br />
&nbsp;  And in their studies meditate it then?<br />
Whether thou dost in Heaven, or earth appear;<br />
Be where thou wilt!&nbsp; Thou wilt not harbour here!&nbsp; <a
name="citation433a"></a><a href="#footnote433a"
class="citation">[433a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Watson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tears of Fancie,&rsquo; 1593.</h4>
<p>In August 1593 there appeared a posthumous collection of sixty-one
sonnets by Thomas Watson, entitled &lsquo;The Tears of Fancie, or Love
Disdained.&rsquo;&nbsp; They are throughout the imitative type of his
previously published &lsquo;Centurie of Love.&rsquo;&nbsp; Many of them
sound the same note as Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets to the &lsquo;dark
lady.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Fletcher&rsquo;s &lsquo;Licia,&rsquo; 1593.</h4>
<p>In September 1593 followed Giles Fletcher&rsquo;s &lsquo;Licia, or Poems
of Love in honour of the admirable and singular virtues of his
Lady.&rsquo;&nbsp; This collection of fifty-three sonnets is dedicated to
the wife of Sir Richard Mollineux.&nbsp; Fletcher makes no concealment that
his sonnets are literary exercises.&nbsp; &lsquo;For this kind of
poetry,&rsquo; he tells the reader, &lsquo;I did it to try my
humour;&rsquo; and on the title-page he notes that the work was written
&lsquo;to the imitation of the best Latin poets and others.&rsquo; <a
name="citation433b"></a><a href="#footnote433b"
class="citation">[433b]</a></p>
<h4>Lodge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Phillis,&rsquo; 1593.</h4>
<p>The most notable contribution to the sonnet-literature of 1593 was
Thomas Lodge&rsquo;s &lsquo;Phillis Honoured with Pastoral Sonnets,
Elegies, and Amorous Delights.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation433c"></a><a
href="#footnote433c" class="citation">[433c]</a>&nbsp; Besides forty
sonnets, some of which exceed fourteen lines in length and others are
shorter, there are included three elegies and an ode.&nbsp; Desportes is
Lodge&rsquo;s chief master, but he had recourse to Ronsard and other French
contemporaries.&nbsp; How servile he could be may be learnt from a
comparison of his Sonnet xxxvi. with Desportes&rsquo;s sonnet from
&lsquo;Les Amours de Diane,&rsquo; livre II. sonnet iii.</p>
<p>Thomas Lodge&rsquo;s Sonnet xxxvi. runs thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;  If so I seek the shades, I presently do see<br />
The god of love forsake his bow and sit me by;<br />
If that I think to write, his Muses pliant be;<br />
If so I plain my grief, the wanton boy will cry.<br />
&nbsp;  <!-- page 434--><a name="page434"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
434</span>If I lament his pride, he doth increase my pain<br />
If tears my cheeks attaint, his cheeks are moist with moan<br />
If I disclose the wounds the which my heart hath slain,<br />
He takes his fascia off, and wipes them dry anon.<br />
&nbsp;  If so I walk the woods, the woods are his delight;<br />
If I myself torment, he bathes him in my blood;<br />
He will my soldier be if once I wend to fight,<br />
If seas delight, he steers my bark amidst the flood.<br />
&nbsp;  In brief, the cruel god doth never from me go,<br />
&nbsp;  But makes my lasting love eternal with my woe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Desportes wrote in &lsquo;Les Amours de Diane,&rsquo; book II. sonnet
iii.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Si ie me si&eacute;s l&rsquo;ombre, aussi soudainement<br />
&nbsp;  Amour, laissant son arc, s&rsquo;assiet et se repose:<br />
&nbsp;  Si ie pense &agrave; des vers, ie le voy qu&rsquo;il compose:<br />
&nbsp;  Si ie plains mes douleurs, il se plaint hautement.<br />
Si ie me plains du mal, il accroist mon tourment:<br />
&nbsp;  Si ie respan des pleurs, son visage il arrose:<br />
&nbsp;  Si ie monstre la playe en ma poitrine enclose,<br />
&nbsp;  Il d&eacute;fait son bandeau l&rsquo;essuyant doucement.<br />
Si ie vay par les bois, aux bois il m&rsquo;accompagne:<br />
&nbsp;  Si ie me suis cruel, dans mon sang il se bagne:<br />
&nbsp;  Si ie vais &agrave; la guerre, it deuient mon soldart:<br />
Si ie passe la mer, il conduit ma nacelle:<br />
&nbsp;  Bref, iamais l&rsquo;inhumain de moy ne se depart,<br />
&nbsp;  Pour rendre mon amour et ma peine eternelle.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Drayton&rsquo;s &lsquo;Idea&rsquo;, 1594.</h4>
<p>Three new volumes in 1594, together with the reissue of Daniel&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Delia&rsquo; and of Constable&rsquo;s &lsquo;Diana&rsquo; (in a
piratical miscellany of sonnets from many pens), prove the steady growth of
the sonnetteering vogue.&nbsp; Michael Drayton in June produced his
&lsquo;Ideas Mirrour, Amours in Quatorzains,&rsquo; containing fifty-one
&lsquo;Amours&rsquo; and a sonnet addressed to &lsquo;his ever kind
Mec&aelig;nas, Anthony Cooke.&rsquo;&nbsp; Drayton acknowledged his
devotion to &lsquo;divine Sir Philip,&rsquo; but by his choice of title,
style, and phraseology, the English sonnetteer once more betrayed his
indebtedness to Desportes and his compeers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Id&eacute;e&rsquo; was the name of a collection of sonnets
by Claude de Pontoux in 1579.&nbsp; Many additions were made by Drayton to
the sonnets that he published in 1594, and many were subtracted before
1619, when there appeared the last edition that was prepared in
Drayton&rsquo;s lifetime.&nbsp; A comparison of the various editions (1594,
1599, 1605, and 1619) shows <!-- page 435--><a name="page435"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 435</span>that Drayton published a hundred sonnets, but
the majority were apparently circulated by him in early life. <a
name="citation435a"></a><a href="#footnote435a"
class="citation">[435a]</a></p>
<h4>Percy&rsquo;s &lsquo;C&oelig;lia,&rsquo; 1594.</h4>
<p>William Percy, the &lsquo;dearest friend&rsquo; of Barnabe Barnes,
published in 1594, in emulation of Barnes, a collection of twenty
&lsquo;Sonnets to the fairest C&oelig;lia.&rsquo; <a
name="citation435b"></a><a href="#footnote435b"
class="citation">[435b]</a>&nbsp; He explains, in an address to the reader,
that out of courtesy he had lent the sonnets to friends, who had secretly
committed them to the press.&nbsp; Making a virtue of necessity, he had
accepted the situation, but begged the reader to treat them as &lsquo;toys
and amorous devices.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Zepheria, 1594.</h4>
<p>A collection of forty sonnets or &lsquo;canzons,&rsquo; as the anonymous
author calls them, also appeared in 1594 with the title
&lsquo;Zepheria.&rsquo; <a name="citation435c"></a><a href="#footnote435c"
class="citation">[435c]</a>&nbsp; In some prefatory verses addressed
&lsquo;Alli veri figlioli delle Muse&rsquo; laudatory reference was made to
the sonnets of Petrarch, Daniel, and Sidney.&nbsp; Several of the sonnets
labour at conceits drawn from the technicalities of the law, and Sir John
Davies parodied these efforts in the eighth of his &lsquo;gulling
sonnets&rsquo; beginning, &lsquo;My case is this, I love Zepheria
bright.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Barnfield&rsquo;s sonnets to Ganymede, 1595.</h4>
<p>Four interesting ventures belong to 1595.&nbsp; In January, appended to
Richard Barnfield&rsquo;s poem of &lsquo;Cynthia,&rsquo; a panegyric on
Queen Elizabeth, was a series of twenty sonnets extolling the personal
charms of a young man in emulation of Virgil&rsquo;s Eclogue ii., in which
the shepherd Corydon addressed the shepherd-boy Alexis. <a
name="citation435d"></a><a href="#footnote435d"
class="citation">[435d]</a>&nbsp; In Sonnet xx. the author expressed regret
that the task of celebrating his young friend&rsquo;s praises had not
fallen to the more capable hand of Spenser (&lsquo;great Colin, chief of
shepherds all&rsquo;) or Drayton (&lsquo;gentle Rowland, my professed
friend&rsquo;).&nbsp; Barnfield at times imitated Shakespeare.</p>
<h4>Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Amoretti&rsquo;, 1595.</h4>
<p>Almost at the same date as Barnfield&rsquo;s &lsquo;Cynthia&rsquo; made
its appearance there was published the more notable collection by Edmund
Spenser of eighty-eight sonnets, which in reference to their Italian origin
he entitled &lsquo;Amoretti.&rsquo; <a name="citation435e"></a><a
href="#footnote435e" class="citation">[435e]</a>&nbsp; Spenser had already
translated many <!-- page 436--><a name="page436"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 436</span>sonnets on philosophic topics of Petrarch and
Joachim Du Bellay.&nbsp; Some of the &lsquo;Amoretti&rsquo; were doubtless
addressed by Spenser in 1593 to the lady who became his wife a year
later.&nbsp; But the sentiment was largely ideal, and, as he says in Sonnet
lxxxvii., he wrote, like Drayton, with his eyes fixed on
&lsquo;Id&aelig;a.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>&lsquo;Emaricdulfe,&rsquo; 1595.</h4>
<p>An unidentified &lsquo;E.C., Esq.,&rsquo; produced also in 1595, under
the title of &lsquo;Emaricdulfe,&rsquo; <a name="citation436a"></a><a
href="#footnote436a" class="citation">[436a]</a> a collection of forty
sonnets, echoing English and French models.&nbsp; In the dedication to his
&lsquo;two very good friends, John Zouch and Edward Fitton Esquiers,&rsquo;
the author tells them that an ague confined him to his chamber, &lsquo;and
to abandon idleness he completed an idle work that he had already begun at
the command and service of a fair dame.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Sir John Davies&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gullinge Sonnets,&rsquo; 1595.</h4>
<p>To 1595 may best be referred the series of nine &lsquo;Gullinge
sonnets,&rsquo; or parodies, which Sir John Davies wrote and circulated in
manuscript, in order to put to shame what he regarded as &lsquo;the bastard
sonnets&rsquo; in vogue.&nbsp; He addressed his collection to Sir Anthony
Cooke, whom Drayton had already celebrated as the Mec&aelig;nas of his
sonnetteering efforts. <a name="citation436b"></a><a href="#footnote436b"
class="citation">[436b]</a>&nbsp; Davies seems to have aimed at Shakespeare
as well as at insignificant rhymers like the author of
&lsquo;Zepheria.&rsquo; <a name="citation436c"></a><a href="#footnote436c"
class="citation">[436c]</a>&nbsp; No. viii. of Davies&rsquo;s
&lsquo;gullinge sonnets,&rsquo; which ridicules the legal metaphors of the
sonnetteers, may be easily matched in the collections of Barnabe Barnes or
of the author of &lsquo;Zepheria,&rsquo; but Davies&rsquo;s phraseology
suggests that he also was glancing at Shakespeare&rsquo;s legal sonnets
lxxxvii. and cxxxiv.&nbsp; Davies&rsquo;s sonnet runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My case is this.&nbsp; I love Zepheria bright,<br />
Of her I hold my heart by fealty:<br />
Which I discharge to her perpetually,<br />
Yet she thereof will never me acquit[e].<br />
For, now supposing I withhold her right,<br />
She hath distrained my heart to satisfy<br />
The duty which I never did deny,<br />
And far away impounds it with despite.<br />
<!-- page 437--><a name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 437</span>I
labour therefore justly to repleave [<i>i.e.</i> recover]<br />
My heart which she unjustly doth impound.<br />
But quick conceit which now is Love&rsquo;s high shreive<br />
Returns it as esloyned [<i>i.e.</i> absconded], not to be found.<br />
Then what the law affords I only crave,<br />
Her heart for mine, in wit her name to have (<i>sic</i>).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Linche&rsquo;s &lsquo;Diella,&rsquo; 1596.</h4>
<p>&lsquo;R. L., gentleman,&rsquo; probably Richard Linche, published in
1596 thirty-nine sonnets under the title &lsquo;Diella.&rsquo; <a
name="citation437a"></a><a href="#footnote437a"
class="citation">[437a]</a>&nbsp; The effort is thoroughly
conventional.&nbsp; In an obsequious address by the publisher, Henry Olney,
to Anne, wife of Sir Henry Glenham, Linche&rsquo;s sonnets are described as
&lsquo;passionate&rsquo; and as &lsquo;conceived in the brain of a gallant
gentleman.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>Griffin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fidessa,&rsquo; 1596.&nbsp; Thomas Campion,
1596.</h4>
<p>To the same year belongs Bartholomew Griffin&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Fidessa,&rsquo; sixty-two sonnets inscribed to &lsquo;William Essex,
Esq.&rsquo;&nbsp; Griffin designates his sonnets as &lsquo;the first fruits
of a young beginner.&rsquo;&nbsp; He is a shameless plagiarist.&nbsp;
Daniel is his chief model, but he also imitated Sidney, Watson, Constable,
and Drayton.&nbsp; Sonnet iii., beginning &lsquo;Venus and young Adonis
sitting by her,&rsquo; is almost identical with the fourth poem&mdash;a
sonnet beginning &lsquo;Sweet Cyther&aelig;a, sitting by a
brook&rsquo;&mdash;in Jaggard&rsquo;s piratical miscellany, &lsquo;The
Passionate Pilgrim,&rsquo; which bore Shakespeare&rsquo;s name on the
title-page. <a name="citation437b"></a><a href="#footnote437b"
class="citation">[437b]</a>&nbsp; Jaggard doubtless stole the poem from
Griffin, although it may be in its essentials the property of some other
poet.&nbsp; Three beautiful love-sonnets by Thomas Campion, which are found
in the Harleian MS. 6910, are there dated 1596. <a
name="citation437c"></a><a href="#footnote437c"
class="citation">[437c]</a></p>
<h4>William Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;Chloris,&rsquo; 1596.</h4>
<p>William Smith was the author of &lsquo;Chloris,&rsquo; a third
collection of sonnets appearing in 1596. <a name="citation437d"></a><a
href="#footnote437d" class="citation">[437d]</a>&nbsp; The volume contains
forty-eight sonnets of love of the ordinary type, with three adulating
Spenser; of these, two open the volume and one concludes it.&nbsp; Smith
says that his sonnets were &lsquo;the budding springs of his
study.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1600 a license was issued by the Stationers&rsquo;
Company for the issue of &lsquo;Amours&rsquo; by <!-- page 438--><a
name="page438"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 438</span>W. S. This no doubt
refers to a second collection of sonnets by William Smith.&nbsp; The
projected volume is not extant. <a name="citation438a"></a><a
href="#footnote438a" class="citation">[438a]</a></p>
<h4>Robert Tofte&rsquo;s &lsquo;Laura,&rsquo; 1597.</h4>
<p>In 1597 there came out a similar volume by Robert Tofte, entitled
&lsquo;Laura, the Joys of a Traveller, or the Feast of Fancy.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The book is divided into three parts, each consisting of forty
&lsquo;sonnets&rsquo; in irregular metres.&nbsp; There is a prose
dedication to Lucy, sister of Henry, ninth Earl of Northumberland.&nbsp;
Tofte tells his patroness that most of his &lsquo;toys&rsquo; &lsquo;were
conceived in Italy.&rsquo;&nbsp; As its name implies, his work is a pale
reflection of Petrarch.&nbsp; A postscript by a friend&mdash;&lsquo;R.
B.&rsquo;&mdash;complains that a publisher had intermingled with
Tofte&rsquo;s genuine efforts &lsquo;more than thirty sonnets not
his.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the style is throughout so uniformly tame that it is
not possible to distinguish the work of a second hand.</p>
<h4>Sir William Alexander&rsquo;s &lsquo;Aurora.&rsquo;</h4>
<p>To the same era belongs Sir William Alexander&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Aurora,&rsquo; a collection of a hundred and six sonnets, with a few
songs and elegies interspersed on French patterns.&nbsp; Sir William
describes the work as &lsquo;the first fancies of his youth,&rsquo; and
formally inscribes it to Agnes, Countess of Argyle.&nbsp; It was not
published till 1604. <a name="citation438b"></a><a href="#footnote438b"
class="citation">[438b]</a></p>
<h4>Sir Fulke Greville&rsquo;s &lsquo;C&aelig;lica.&rsquo;</h4>
<p>Sir Fulke Greville, afterwards Lord Brooke, the intimate friend of Sir
Philip Sidney, was author of a like collection of sonnets called
&lsquo;C&aelig;lica.&rsquo;&nbsp; The poems number a hundred and nine, but
few are in strict sonnet metre.&nbsp; Only a small proportion profess to be
addressed to the poet&rsquo;s fictitious mistress, C&aelig;lica.&nbsp; Many
celebrate the <!-- page 439--><a name="page439"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 439</span>charms of another beauty named Myra, and
others invoke Queen Elizabeth under her poetic name of Cynthia (cf. Sonnet
xvii.)&nbsp; There are also many addresses to Cupid and meditations on more
or less metaphysical themes, but the tone is never very serious.&nbsp;
Greville doubtless wrote the majority of his &lsquo;Sonnets&rsquo; during
the period under survey, though they were not published until their
author&rsquo;s works appeared in folio for the first time in 1633, five
years after his death.</p>
<h4>Estimate of number of love-sonnets issued between 1591 and 1597.</h4>
<p>With Tofte&rsquo;s volume in 1597 the publication of collections of
love-sonnets practically ceased.&nbsp; Only two collections on a voluminous
scale seem to have been written in the early years of the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; About 1607 William Drummond of Hawthornden penned a series
of sixty-eight interspersed with songs, madrigals, and sextains, nearly all
of which were translated or adapted from modern Italian sonnetteers. <a
name="citation439a"></a><a href="#footnote439a"
class="citation">[439a]</a>&nbsp; About 1610 John Davies of Hereford
published his &lsquo;Wittes Pilgrimage . . . through a world of Amorous
Sonnets.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of more than two hundred separate poems in this
volume, only the hundred and four sonnets in the opening section make any
claim to answer the description on the title-page, and the majority of
those are metaphysical meditations on love which are not addressed to any
definite person.&nbsp; Some years later William Browne penned a sequence of
fourteen love-sonnets entitled &lsquo;C&aelig;lia&rsquo; and a few detached
sonnets of the same type. <a name="citation439b"></a><a
href="#footnote439b" class="citation">[439b]</a>&nbsp; The dates of
production of Drummond&rsquo;s, Davies&rsquo;s, and Browne&rsquo;s sonnets
exclude them from the present field of view.&nbsp; Omitting them, we find
that between 1591 and 1597 there had been printed nearly twelve hundred
sonnets of the amorous kind.&nbsp; If to these we add Shakespeare&rsquo;s
poems, and make allowance for others which, only circulating in manuscript,
have not reached us, it is seen that more than two hundred love-sonnets
were produced in each of the six years under survey.&nbsp; France and Italy
directed their literary energies in like direction during nearly the whole
of the century, but at no other <!-- page 440--><a name="page440"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 440</span>period and in no other country did the
love-sonnet dominate literature to a greater extent than in England between
1591 and 1597.</p>
<p>Of sonnets to patrons between 1591 and 1597, of which detached specimens
may be found in nearly every published book of the period, the chief
collections were:</p>
<h4>II.&nbsp; Sonnets to patrons, 1591-7.</h4>
<p>A long series of sonnets prefixed to &lsquo;Poetical Exercises of a
Vacant Hour&rsquo; by King James VI of Scotland, 1591; twenty-three sonnets
in Gabriel Harvey&rsquo;s &lsquo;Four Letters and certain Sonnets touching
Robert Greene&rsquo; (1592), including Edmund Spenser&rsquo;s fine sonnet
of compliment addressed to Harvey; a series of sonnets to noble patronesses
by Constable circulated in manuscript about 1592 (first printed in
&lsquo;Harleian Miscellany,&rsquo; 1813, ix. 491); six adulatory sonnets
appended by Barnabe Barnes to his &lsquo;Parthenophil&rsquo; in May 1593;
four sonnets to &lsquo;Sir Philip Sidney&rsquo;s soul,&rsquo; prefixed to
the first edition of Sidney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Apologie for Poetrie&rsquo;
(1595); seventeen sonnets which were originally prefixed to the first
edition of Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Faerie Queene,&rsquo; bk. i.-iii., in
1590, and were reprinted in the edition of 1596; <a
name="citation440"></a><a href="#footnote440" class="citation">[440]</a>
sixty sonnets to peers, peeresses, and officers of state, appended to Henry
Locke&rsquo;s (or Lok&rsquo;s) &lsquo;Ecclesiasticus&rsquo; (1597); forty
sonnets by Joshua Sylvester addressed to Henry IV of France &lsquo;upon the
late miraculous peace in Fraunce&rsquo; (1599); Sir John Davies&rsquo;s
series of twenty-six octosyllabic sonnets, which he entitled &lsquo;Hymnes
of Astr&aelig;a,&rsquo; all extravagantly eulogising Queen Elizabeth
(1599).</p>
<h4>III.&nbsp; Sonnets on philosophy and religion.</h4>
<p>The collected sonnets on religion and philosophy that appeared in the
period 1591-7 include sixteen &lsquo;Spirituall Sonnettes to the honour of
God and Hys Saynts,&rsquo; written by Constable about 1593, and circulated
only in manuscript; these were first printed from a manuscript in the
Harleian collection (5993) by Thomas Park in &lsquo;Heliconia,&rsquo; 1815,
vol. ii.&nbsp; In 1595 Barnabe Barnes published <!-- page 441--><a
name="page441"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 441</span>a &lsquo;Divine
Centurie of Spirituall Sonnets,&rsquo; and, in dedicating the collection to
Toby Matthew, bishop of Durham, mentions that they were written a year
before, while travelling in France.&nbsp; They are closely modelled on the
two series of &lsquo;Sonnets Spirituels&rsquo; which the Abb&eacute;
Jacques de Billy published in Paris in 1573 and 1578 respectively.&nbsp; A
long series of &lsquo;Sonnets Spirituels&rsquo; written by Anne de
Marquets, a sister of the Dominican Order, who died at Poissy in 1598, was
first published in Paris in 1605.&nbsp; In 1594 George Chapman published
ten sonnets in praise of philosophy, which he entitled &lsquo;A Coronet for
his Mistress Philosophy.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the opening poem he states that
his aim was to dissuade poets from singing in sonnets &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s
Sensual Empery.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1597 Henry Locke (or Lok) appended to his
verse-rendering of Ecclesiastes <a name="citation441a"></a><a
href="#footnote441a" class="citation">[441a]</a> a collection of
&lsquo;Sundrie Sonets of Christian Passions, with other Affectionate Sonets
of a Feeling Conscience.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lok had in 1593 obtained a license to
publish &lsquo;a hundred Sonnets on Meditation, Humiliation, and
Prayer,&rsquo; but that work is not extant.&nbsp; In the volume of 1597 his
sonnets on religious or philosophical themes number no fewer than three
hundred and twenty-eight. <a name="citation441b"></a><a
href="#footnote441b" class="citation">[441b]</a></p>
<p>Thus in the total of sonnets published between 1591 and 1597 must be
included at least five hundred sonnets addressed to patrons, and as many on
philosophy and religion.&nbsp; The aggregate far exceeds two thousand.</p>

442</span>X.&mdash;BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON THE SONNET IN FRANCE,
1550-1600.</h3>
<h4>Ronsard (1524-1585) and &lsquo;La Pl&eacute;iade.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Desportes (1546-1606).</h4>
<p>In the earlier years of the sixteenth century Melin de Saint-Gelais
(1487-1558) and Cl&eacute;ment Marot (1496-1544) made a few scattered
efforts at sonnetteering in France; and Maurice S&egrave;ve laid down the
lines of all sonnet-sequences on themes of love in his dixains entitled
&lsquo;D&eacute;lie&rsquo; (1544).&nbsp; But it was Ronsard (1524-1585), in
the second half of the century, who first gave the sonnet a pronounced
vogue in France.&nbsp; The sonnet was handled with the utmost assiduity not
only by Ronsard, but by all the literary comrades whom he gathered round
him, and on whom he bestowed the title of &lsquo;La
Pl&eacute;iade.&rsquo;&nbsp; The leading aim that united Ronsard and his
friends was the re-formation of the French language and literature on
classical models.&nbsp; But they assimilated and naturalised in France not
only much that was admirable in Latin and Greek poetry, <a
name="citation442a"></a><a href="#footnote442a" class="citation">[442a]</a>
but all that was best in the recent Italian literature. <a
name="citation442b"></a><a href="#footnote442b"
class="citation">[442b]</a>&nbsp; Although they were learned poets, Ronsard
<!-- page 443--><a name="page443"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
443</span>and the majority of his associates had a natural lyric vein,
which gave their poetry the charms of freshness and spontaneity.&nbsp; The
true members of &lsquo;La Pl&eacute;iade,&rsquo; according to
Ronsard&rsquo;s own statement, were, besides himself, Joachim du Bellay
(1524-1560); Estienne Jodelle (1532-1573); Remy Belleau (1528-1577); Jean
Dinemandy, usually known as Daurat or Dorat (1508-1588), Ronsard&rsquo;s
classical teacher in early life; Jean-Antoine de Ba&iuml;f (1532-1589); and
Ponthus de Thyard (1521-1605).&nbsp; Others of Ronsard&rsquo;s literary
allies are often loosely reckoned among the
&lsquo;Pl&eacute;iade.&rsquo;&nbsp; These writers include Jean de la
P&eacute;ruse (1529-1554), Olivier de Magny (1530-1559), Amadis Jamyn
(1538?-1585), Jean Passerat (1534-1602), Philippe Desportes (1546-1606),
Estienne Pasquier (1529-1615), Sc&eacute;vole de Sainte-Marthe (1536-1623),
and Jean Bertaut (1552-1611).&nbsp; These subordinate members of the
&lsquo;Pl&eacute;iade&rsquo; were no less devoted to sonnetteering than the
original members.&nbsp; Of those in this second rank, Desportes was most
popular in France as well as in England.&nbsp; Although many of
Desportes&rsquo;s sonnets are graceful in thought and melodious in rhythm,
most of them abound in overstrained conceits.&nbsp; Not only was Desportes
a more slavish imitator of Petrarch than the members of the
&lsquo;Pl&eacute;iade,&rsquo; but he encouraged numerous disciples to
practise &lsquo;Petrarchism,&rsquo; as the imitation of Petrarch was
called, beyond healthful limits.&nbsp; Under the influence of Desportes the
French sonnet became, during the latest years of the sixteenth century,
little more than an empty and fantastic echo of the Italian.</p>
<h4>Chief collections of French sonnets published between 1550 and
1584.</h4>
<p>The following statistics will enable the reader to realise how closely
the sonnetteering movement in France adumbrated that <!-- page 444--><a
name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span>in England.&nbsp; The
collective edition in 1584 of the works of Ronsard, the master of the
&lsquo;Pl&eacute;iade,&rsquo; contains more than nine hundred separate
sonnets arranged under such titles as &lsquo;Amours de Cassandre,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Amours de Marie,&rsquo; &lsquo;Amours pour Astr&eacute;e,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Amours pour H&eacute;l&egrave;ne;&rsquo; besides &lsquo;Amours
Divers&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sonnets Divers,&rsquo; complimentary addresses to
friends and patrons.&nbsp; Du Bellay&rsquo;s &lsquo;Olive,&rsquo; a
collection of love sonnets, first published in 1549, reached a total of a
hundred and fifteen.&nbsp; &lsquo;Les Regrets,&rsquo; Du Bellay&rsquo;s
sonnets on general topics, some of which Edmund Spenser first translated
into English, numbered in the edition of 1565 a hundred and
eighty-three.&nbsp; De Ba&iuml;f published two long series of sonnets,
entitled respectively &lsquo;Les Amours de Meline&rsquo; (1552) and
&lsquo;Les Amours de Francine&rsquo; (1555).&nbsp; Amadis Jamyn was
responsible for &lsquo;Les Amours d&rsquo;Oriane,&rsquo; &lsquo;Les Amours
de Callir&eacute;e,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Les Amours d&rsquo;Artemis&rsquo;
(1575).&nbsp; Desportes&rsquo;s &lsquo;Premieres &OElig;uvres&rsquo;
(1575), a very popular book in England, included more than three hundred
sonnets&mdash;a hundred and fifty being addressed to Diane, eighty-six to
Hippolyte, and ninety-one to Cleonice.&nbsp; Ponthus de Thyard produced
between 1549 and 1555 three series of his &lsquo;Erreurs Amoureuses,&rsquo;
sonnets addressed to Pasith&eacute;e, and Belleau brought out a volume of
&lsquo;Amours&rsquo; in 1576.</p>
<h4>Minor collections of French sonnets published between 1553 and
1605.</h4>

<i>Shakespeare</i>, <i>Puritan and Recusant</i>, 1897, has endeavoured to
show that John Shakespeare was a puritan in religious matters, inclining to
nonconformity.&nbsp; He deduces this inference from the fact that, at the
period of his prominent association with the municipal government of
Stratford, the corporation ordered images to be defaced (1562-3) and
ecclesiastical vestments to be sold (1571).&nbsp; These entries merely
prove that the aldermen and councillors of Stratford strictly conformed to
the new religion as by law established in the first years of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; Nothing can be deduced from them in regard
to the private religious opinions of John Shakespeare.&nbsp; The
circumstance that he was the first bailiff to encourage actors to visit
Stratford is, on the other hand, conclusive proof that his religion was not
that of the contemporary puritan, whose hostility to all forms of dramatic
representations was one of his most persistent characteristics.&nbsp; The
Elizabethan puritans, too, according to Guillim&rsquo;s <i>Display of
Heraldrie</i> (1610), regarded coat-armour with abhorrence, yet John
Shakespeare with his son made persistent application to the College of Arms
for a grant of arms.&nbsp; (Cf. <i>infra</i>, p. 187 seq.)</p>
<p><a name="footnote12a"></a><a href="#citation12a"
class="footnote">[12a]</a>&nbsp; The sum is stated to be &pound;4 in one
document (Halliwell-Phillipps, ii. 176) and &pound;40 in another
(<i>ib.</i> p. 179); the latter is more likely to be correct.</p>

<p><a name="footnote12c"></a><a href="#citation12c"
class="footnote">[12c]</a>&nbsp; Efforts recently made to assign the
embarrassments of Shakespeare&rsquo;s father to another John Shakespeare of
Stratford deserve little attention.&nbsp; The second John Shakespeare or
Shakspere (as his name is usually spelt) came to Stratford as a young man
in 1584, and was for ten years a well-to-do shoemaker in Bridge Street,
filling the office of Master of the Shoemakers&rsquo; Company in
1592&mdash;a certain sign of pecuniary stability.&nbsp; He left Stratford
in 1594 (cf. Halliwell-Phillipps, 137-40).</p>
<p><a name="footnote13"></a><a href="#citation13"
class="footnote">[13]</a>&nbsp; James Russell Lowell, who noticed some
close parallels between expressions of Shakespeare and those of the Greek
tragedians, hazarded the suggestion that Shakespeare may have studied the
ancient drama in a <i>Grac&egrave; et Latin&egrave;</i> edition.&nbsp; I
believe Lowell&rsquo;s parallelisms to be no more than curious
accidents&mdash;proofs of consanguinity of spirit, not of any indebtedness
on Shakespeare&rsquo;s part.&nbsp; In the <i>Electra</i> of Sophocles,
which is akin in its leading motive to <i>Hamlet</i>, the Chorus consoles
Electra for the supposed death of Orestes with the same commonplace
argument as that with which Hamlet&rsquo;s mother and uncle seek to console
him.&nbsp; In <i>Electra</i>, are the lines 1171-3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&Theta;&nu;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;
&pi;&#941;&phi;&upsilon;&kappa;&alpha;&sigmaf;
&pi;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;,

&pi;&alpha;&theta;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<i>i.e.</i> &lsquo;Remember, Electra, your father whence you sprang is
mortal.&nbsp; Mortal, too, is Orestes.&nbsp; Wherefore grieve not overmuch,
for by all of us has this debt of suffering to be paid&rsquo;).&nbsp; In
<i>Hamlet</i> (I. ii. 72 sq.) are the familiar sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thou know&rsquo;st &rsquo;tis common; all that live must die.<br />
But you must know, your father lost a father;<br />
That father lost, lost his . . .&nbsp; But to pers&egrave;ver<br />
In obstinate condolement is a course<br />
Of impious stubbornness.</p>
</blockquote>

cause the weak vanquishes the strong,&rsquo; Jebb), and 2 <i>Henry VI</i>,
iii. 233, &lsquo;Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel
just.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;prophetic soul&rsquo; in
<i>Hamlet</i> (I. v. 40) and the <i>Sonnets</i> (cvii. I) may be matched by
the &pi;&rho;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;
&theta;&upsilon;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf; of Euripides&rsquo;s
<i>Andromache</i>, 1075; and Hamlet&rsquo;s &lsquo;sea of troubles&rsquo;
(III. i. 59) by the &kappa;&alpha;&kappa;&omega;&nu;
&pi;&#941;&lambda;&alpha;&gamma;&omicron;&sigmaf; of &AElig;schylus&rsquo;s
<i>Pers&aelig;</i>, 443.&nbsp; Among all the creations of Shakespearean and
Greek drama, Lady Macbeth and &AElig;schylus&rsquo;s Clytemnestra, who
&lsquo;in man&rsquo;s counsels bore no woman&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;
(&gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;

&epsilon;&lambda;&pi;&#943;&zeta;&omicron;&nu; &kappa;&#941;&alpha;&rho;,
<i>Agamemnon</i>, II), most closely resemble each other.&nbsp; But a study
of the points of resemblance attests no knowledge of &AElig;schylus on
Shakespeare&rsquo;s part, but merely the close community of tragic genius
that subsisted between the two poets.</p>

class="footnote">[24]</a>&nbsp; No marriage registers of the period are
extant at Temple Grafton to inform us whether Anne Whately actually married
<i>her</i> William Shakespeare or who precisely the parties were.&nbsp; A
Whateley family resided in Stratford, but there is nothing to show that
Anne of Temple Grafton was connected with it.&nbsp; The chief argument
against the conclusion that the marriage license and the marriage bond
concerned different couples lies in the apparent improbability that two
persons, both named William Shakespeare, should on two successive days not
only be arranging with the Bishop of Worcester&rsquo;s official to marry,
but should be involving themselves, whether on their own initiative or on
that of their friends, in more elaborate and expensive forms of procedure
than were habitual to the humbler ranks of contemporary society.&nbsp; But
the Worcester diocese covered a very wide area, and was honeycombed with
Shakespeare families of all degrees of gentility.&nbsp; The William
Shakespeare whom Anne Whately was licensed to marry may have been of a
superior station, to which marriage by license was deemed

William Shakespeare of the marriage bond with the William Shakespeare of
the marriage license, a romantic theory has been based to the effect that
&lsquo;Anne Whateley of Temple Grafton,&rsquo; believing herself to have a
just claim to the poet&rsquo;s hand, secured the license on hearing of the
proposed action of Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s friends, and hoped, by moving in
the matter a day before the Shottery husbandmen, to insure
Shakespeare&rsquo;s fidelity to his alleged pledges.</p>

Burbage, the chief actor with whom Shakespeare was associated, was a native
of Stratford is wholly erroneous.&nbsp; Richard was born in Shoreditch, and
his father came from Hertfordshire.&nbsp; John Heming, another of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s actor-friends who has also been claimed as a native of
Stratford, was beyond reasonable doubt born at Droitwich in
Worcestershire.&nbsp; Thomas Greene, a popular comic actor at the Red Bull
Theatre early in the seventeenth century, is conjectured to have belonged
to Stratford on no grounds that deserve attention; Shakespeare was in no

<p>Men taking women&rsquo;s parts seem to have worn masks.&nbsp; Flute is

of the time women seem to have acted publicly, but until the Restoration
public opinion in England deemed the appearance of a woman on a public
stage to be an act of shamelessness on which the most disreputable of her
sex would hardly venture.&nbsp; With a curious inconsistency ladies of rank
were encouraged at Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s Court, and still more frequently
at the Courts of James I and Charles I, to take part in private and amateur
representations of masques and short dramatic pageants.&nbsp; During the
reign of James I scenic decoration, usually designed by Inigo Jones,
accompanied the production of masques in the royal palaces, but until the
Restoration the public stages were bare of any scenic contrivance except a
front curtain opening in the middle and a balcony or upper platform resting
on pillars at the back of the stage, from which portions of the dialogue
were sometimes spoken, although occasionally the balcony seems to have been
occupied by spectators (cf. a sketch made by a Dutch visitor to London in
1596 of the stage of the Swan Theatre in <i>Zur Kenntniss der altenglischen
B&uuml;hne von Karl Theodor Gaedertz</i>.&nbsp; <i>Mit der ersten
authentischen innern Ansicht der Schwans Theater in London</i>, Bremen,
1888).&nbsp; Sir Philip Sidney humorously described the spectator&rsquo;s
difficulties in an Elizabethan playhouse, where, owing to the absence of
stage scenery, he had to imagine the bare boards to present in rapid
succession a garden, a rocky coast, a cave, and a battlefield (<i>Apologie
for Poetrie</i>, p. 52).&nbsp; Three flourishes on a trumpet announced the
beginning of the performance, but a band of fiddlers played music between
the acts.&nbsp; The scenes of each act were played without

publishing of plays in the belief that their dissemination in print was
injurious to the receipts of the theatre.&nbsp; A very small proportion of
plays acted in Elizabeth&rsquo;s and James I&rsquo;s reign consequently
reached the printing press, and most of them are now lost.&nbsp; But in the
absence of any law of copyright publishers often defied the wishes of the
owner of manuscripts.&nbsp; Many copies of a popular play were made for the
actors, and if one of these copies chanced to fall into a publisher&rsquo;s
hands, it was habitually issued without any endeavour to obtain either
author&rsquo;s or manager&rsquo;s sanction.&nbsp; In March 1599 the
theatrical manager Philip Henslowe endeavoured to induce a publisher who
had secured a playhouse copy of the comedy of <i>Patient Grissell</i> by
Dekker, Chettle, and Haughton to abandon the publication of it by offering
him a bribe of &pound;2.&nbsp; The publication was suspended till 1603 (cf.
Henslowe&rsquo;s <i>Diary</i>, p. 167).&nbsp; As late as 1633 Thomas
Heywood wrote of &lsquo;some actors who think it against their peculiar

dominions the scene is laid.&nbsp; The two chief lords in attendance on him
in the play, Biron and Longaville, bear the actual names of the two most
strenuous supporters of the real King of Navarre (Biron&rsquo;s later
career subsequently formed the subject of two plays by Chapman, <i>The
Conspiracie of Duke Biron</i> and <i>The Tragedy of Biron</i>, which were
both produced in 1605).&nbsp; The name of the Lord Dumain in
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> is a common anglicised version of
that Duc de Maine or Mayenne whose name was so frequently mentioned in
popular accounts of French affairs in connection with Navarre&rsquo;s
movements that Shakespeare was led to number him also among his
supporters.&nbsp; Mothe or La Mothe, the name of the pretty, ingenious
page, was that of a French ambassador who was long popular in London; and,
though he left England in 1583, he lived in the memory of playgoers and
playwrights long after <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> was
written.&nbsp; In Chapman&rsquo;s <i>An Humourous Day&rsquo;s Mirth</i>,
1599, M. Le Mot, a sprightly courtier in attendance on the King of France,
is drawn from the same original, and his name, as in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
play, suggests much punning on the word &lsquo;mote.&rsquo;&nbsp; As late
as 1602 Middleton, in his <i>Blurt</i>, <i>Master Constable</i>, act ii.
scene ii. line 215, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ho God! Ho God! thus did I revel it<br />
When Monsieur Motte lay here ambassador.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Armado, &lsquo;the fantastical Spaniard&rsquo; who haunts
Navarre&rsquo;s Court, and is dubbed by another courtier &lsquo;a phantasm,
a Monarcho,&rsquo; is a caricature of a half-crazed Spaniard known as
&lsquo;fantastical Monarcho&rsquo; who for many years hung about
Elizabeth&rsquo;s Court, and was under the delusion that he owned the ships
arriving in the port of London.&nbsp; On his death Thomas Churchyard wrote
a poem called <i>Fantasticall Monarcho&rsquo;s Epitaph</i>, and mention is
made of him in Reginald Scott&rsquo;s <i>Discoverie of Witchcraft</i>,
1584, p. 54.&nbsp; The name Armado was doubtless suggested by the
expedition of 1588.&nbsp; Braggardino in Chapman&rsquo;s <i>Blind Beggar of
Alexandria</i>, 1598, is drawn on the same lines.&nbsp; The scene
(<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, V. ii. 158 sqq.) in which the
princess&rsquo;s lovers press their suit in the disguise of Russians
follows a description of the reception by ladies of Elizabeth&rsquo;s Court
in 1584 of Russian ambassadors who came to London to seek a wife among the
ladies of the English nobility for the Tsar (cf. Horsey&rsquo;s
<i>Travels</i>, ed. E. A. Bond, Hakluyt Soc.)&nbsp; For further indications

physician before 1586, and the Queen&rsquo;s chief physician from that
date.&nbsp; An accomplished linguist, with friends in all parts of Europe,
he acted in 1590, at the request of the Earl of Essex, as interpreter to
Antonio Perez, a victim of Philip II&rsquo;s persecution, whom Essex and
his associates brought to England in order to stimulate the hostility of
the English public to Spain.&nbsp; Don Antonio (as the refugee was
popularly called) proved querulous and exacting.&nbsp; A quarrel between
Lopez and Essex followed.&nbsp; Spanish agents in London offered Lopez a
bribe to poison Antonio and the Queen.&nbsp; The evidence that he assented
to the murderous proposal is incomplete, but he was convicted of treason,
and, although the Queen long delayed signing his death-warrant, he was
hanged at Tyburn on June 7, 1594.&nbsp; His trial and execution evoked a
marked display of anti-Semitism on the part of the London populace.&nbsp;
Very few Jews were domiciled in England at the time.&nbsp; That a Christian
named Antonio should be the cause of the ruin alike of the greatest Jew in
Elizabethan England and of the greatest Jew of the Elizabethan drama is a
curious confirmation of the theory that Lopez was the begetter of
Shylock.&nbsp; Cf. the article on Roderigo Lopez in the <i>Dictionary of

his friend Florio,&rsquo; runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweet friend whose name agrees with thy increase<br />
&nbsp; How fit arrival art thou of the Spring!<br />
&nbsp; For when each branch hath left his flourishing,<br />
&nbsp; And green-locked Summer&rsquo;s shady pleasures cease:<br />
She makes the Winter&rsquo;s storms repose in peace,<br />
&nbsp; And spends her franchise on each living thing:<br />
&nbsp; The daisies sprout, the little birds do sing,<br />
&nbsp; Herbs, gums, and plants do vaunt of their release.<br />
So when that all our English Wits lay dead,<br />
&nbsp; (Except the laurel that is ever green)<br />
&nbsp; Thou with thy Fruit our barrenness o&rsquo;erspread,<br />
&nbsp; And set thy flowery pleasance to be seen.<br />
Such fruits, such flow&rsquo;rets of morality,<br />
&nbsp; Were ne&rsquo;er before brought out of Italy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cf. Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnet xcviii. beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When proud-pied April, dress&rsquo;d in all his trim,<br />
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But like descriptions of Spring and Summer formed a topic that was
common to all the sonnets of the period.&nbsp; Much has been written of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s alleged acquaintance with Florio.&nbsp; Farmer and
Warburton argue that Shakespeare ridiculed Florio in Holofernes in
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>.&nbsp; They chiefly rely on
Florio&rsquo;s bombastic prefaces to his <i>Worlde of Wordes</i> and his
translation of Montaigne&rsquo;s <i>Essays</i> (1603).&nbsp; There is
nothing there to justify the suggestion.&nbsp; Florio writes more in the
vein of Armado than of Holofernes, and, beyond the fact that he was a
teacher of languages to noblemen, he bears no resemblance to Holofernes, a
village schoolmaster.&nbsp; Shakespeare doubtless knew Florio as
Southampton&rsquo;s <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, and read his fine
translation of Montaigne&rsquo;s <i>Essays</i> with delight.&nbsp; He
quotes from it in <i>The Tempest</i>: see p. 253.</p>
<p><a name="footnote86"></a><a href="#citation86"
class="footnote">[86]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare writes in his Sonnets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My glass shall not persuade me I am old (xxii. 1.).<br />
But when my glass shows me myself indeed,<br />
Beated and chopp&rsquo;d with tann&rsquo;d antiquity (lxii. 9-10).<br />
That time of year thou mayst in me behold<br />
When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang (lxxiii. 1-2).<br />
My days are past the best (cxxxviii. 6).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daniel in <i>Delia</i> (xxiii.) in 1591, when twenty-nine years old,
exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My years draw on my everlasting night,<br />
. . .&nbsp; My days are done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Barnfield, at the age of twenty, bade the boy Ganymede, to whom
he addressed his <i>Affectionate Shepherd</i> and a sequence of sonnets in
1594 (ed. Arber, p. 23):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold my gray head, full of silver hairs,<br />
My wrinkled skin, deep furrows in my face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly Drayton in a sonnet (<i>Idea</i>, xiv.) published in 1594,
when he was barely thirty-one, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking into the glass of my youth&rsquo;s miseries,<br />
I see the ugly face of my deformed cares<br />
With withered brows all wrinkled with despairs;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and a little later (No. xliii. of the 1599 edition) he repeated how</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Age rules my lines with wrinkles in my face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All these lines are echoes of Petrarch, and Shakespeare and Drayton
followed the Italian master&rsquo;s words more closely than their
contemporaries.&nbsp; Cf. Petrarch&rsquo;s Sonnet cxliii. (to Laura alive),
or Sonnet lxxxi. (to Laura after death); the latter begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dicemi spesso il mio fidato speglio,<br />
&nbsp; L&rsquo;animo stanco e la cangiata scorza<br />
&nbsp; E la scemata mia destrezza e forza:<br />
&nbsp; Non ti nasconder pi&ugrave;: tu se&rsquo; pur veglio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<i>i.e.</i> &lsquo;My faithful glass, my weary spirit and my wrinkled
skin, and my decaying wit and strength repeatedly tell me: &ldquo;It cannot
longer be hidden from you, you are old.&rdquo;&rsquo;)</p>

class="footnote">[88]</a>&nbsp; The Sonnets of Sidney, Watson, Daniel, and
Constable long circulated in manuscript, and suffered much the same fate as
Shakespeare&rsquo;s at the hands of piratical publishers.&nbsp; After
circulating many years in manuscript, Sidney&rsquo;s Sonnets were published
in 1591 by an irresponsible trader, Thomas Newman, who in his
self-advertising dedication wrote of the collection that it had been widely
&lsquo;spread abroad in written copies,&rsquo; and had &lsquo;gathered much
corruption by ill writers&rsquo; [i.e. copyists].&nbsp; Constable produced
in 1592 a collection of twenty sonnets in a volume which he entitled
&lsquo;Diana.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was an authorised publication.&nbsp; But in
1594 a printer and a publisher, without Constable&rsquo;s knowledge or
sanction, reprinted these sonnets and scattered them through a volume of
nearly eighty miscellaneous sonnets by Sidney and many other hands; the
adventurous publishers bestowed on their medley the title of
&lsquo;Diana,&rsquo; which Constable had distinctively attached to his own
collection.&nbsp; Daniel suffered in much the same way.&nbsp; See Appendix
IX. for further notes on the subject.&nbsp; Proofs of the commonness of the
habit of circulating literature in manuscript abound.&nbsp; Fulke Greville,
writing to Sidney&rsquo;s father-in-law, Sir Francis Walsingham, in 1587,
expressed regret that uncorrected manuscript copies of the then unprinted
<i>Arcadia</i> were &lsquo;so common.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1591 Gabriel Cawood,
the publisher of Robert Southwell&rsquo;s <i>Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Funeral
Tears</i>, wrote that manuscript copies of the work had long flown about
&lsquo;fast and false.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nash, in the preface to his <i>Terrors
of the Night</i>, 1594, described how a copy of that essay, which a friend
had &lsquo;wrested&rsquo; from him, had &lsquo;progressed [without his
authority] from one scrivener&rsquo;s shop to another, and at length grew
so common that it was ready to be hung out for one of their figures
[<i>i.e.</i> shop-signs], like a pair of indentures.&rsquo;</p>

regret to find myself in more or less complete disagreement with all these
writers, although I am at one with Mr. Massey in identifying the young man
to whom many of the sonnets were addressed with the Earl of
Southampton.&nbsp; A short bibliography of the works advocating the theory
that the sonnets were addressed to William, third Earl of Pembroke, is

Shakespeare asserts in Sonnets cxxxv-vi. and cxliii. that the young friend
to whom he addressed some of the sonnets bore his own christian name of
Will (see for a full examination of these sonnets Appendix VIII.)&nbsp;
Further, it has been fantastically suggested that the line (xx. 7)
describing the youth as &lsquo;A man in hue, all hues in his
controlling&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i> a man in colour or complexion whose charms
are so varied as to appear to give his countenance control of, or enable it
to assume, all manner of fascinating hues or complexions), and other
applications to the youth of the ordinary word &lsquo;hue,&rsquo; imply
that his surname was Hughes.&nbsp; There is no other pretence of argument
for the conclusion, which a few critics have hazarded in all seriousness,
that the friend&rsquo;s name was William Hughes.&nbsp; There was a
contemporary musician called William Hughes, but no known contemporary of
the name, either in age or position in life, bears any resemblance to the
young man who is addressed by Shakespeare in his sonnets.</p>

class="footnote">[95b]</a>&nbsp; The form of fourteen-line stanza adopted
by Shakespeare is in no way peculiar to himself.&nbsp; It is the type
recognised by Elizabethan writers on metre as correct and customary in
England long before he wrote.&nbsp; George Gascoigne, in his <i>Certayne
Notes of Instruction concerning the making of Verse or Ryme in English</i>
(published in Gascoigne&rsquo;s <i>Posies</i>, 1575), defined sonnets thus:
&lsquo;Fouretene lynes, every lyne conteyning tenne syllables.&nbsp; The
first twelve to ryme in staves of foure lynes by cross metre and the last
two ryming togither, do conclude the whole.&rsquo;&nbsp; In twenty-one of
the 108 sonnets of which Sidney&rsquo;s collection entitled <i>Astrophel
and Stella</i> consists, the rhymes are on the foreign model and the final
couplet is avoided.&nbsp; But these are exceptional.&nbsp; As is not
uncommon in Elizabethan sonnet-collections, one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets (xcix.) has fifteen lines; another (cxxvi.) has only twelve lines,
and those in rhymed couplets (cf. Lodge&rsquo;s <i>Phillis</i>, Nos. viii.
and xxvi.) and a third (cxlv.) is in octosyllabics.&nbsp; But it is very
doubtful whether the second and third of these sonnets rightly belong to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s collection.&nbsp; They were probably written as
independent lyrics: see p. 97, note 1.</p>
<p><a name="footnote96"></a><a href="#citation96"
class="footnote">[96]</a>&nbsp; If the critical ingenuity which has
detected a continuous thread of narrative in the order that Thorpe printed
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets were applied to the booksellers&rsquo;
miscellany of sonnets called <i>Diana</i> (1594), that volume, which rakes
together sonnets on all kinds of amorous subjects from all quarters and
numbers them consecutively, could be made to reveal the sequence of an
individual lover&rsquo;s moods quite as readily, and, if no external
evidence were admitted, quite as convincingly, as Thorpe&rsquo;s collection
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets.&nbsp; Almost all Elizabethan sonnets are
not merely in the like metre, but are pitched in what sounds superficially
to be the same key of pleading or yearning.&nbsp; Thus almost every
collection gives at a first perusal a specious and delusive impression of
homogeneity.</p>
<p><a name="footnote97"></a><a href="#citation97"
class="footnote">[97]</a>&nbsp; Shakespeare merely warns his &lsquo;lovely
boy&rsquo; that, though he be now the &lsquo;minion&rsquo; of
Nature&rsquo;s &lsquo;pleasure,&rsquo; he will not succeed in defying
Time&rsquo;s inexorable law.&nbsp; Sidney addresses in a lighter vein
Cupid&mdash;&lsquo;blind hitting boy,&rsquo; he calls him&mdash;in his
<i>Astrophel</i> (No. xlvi.)&nbsp; Cupid is similarly invoked in three of
Drayton&rsquo;s sonnets (No. xxvi. in the edition of 1594, and Nos. xxxiii.
and xxxiv. in that of 1605), and in six in Fulke Greville&rsquo;s
collection entitled <i>C&oelig;lica</i> (cf. lxxxiv., beginning
&lsquo;Farewell, sweet boy, complain not of my truth&rsquo;).&nbsp; Lyly,
in his <i>Sapho and Phao</i>, 1584, and in his <i>Mother Bombie</i>, 1598,
has songs of like temper addressed in the one case to &lsquo;O Cruel
love!&rsquo; and in the other to &lsquo;O Cupid! monarch over
kings.&rsquo;&nbsp; A similar theme to that of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnet
cxxvi. is treated by John Ford in the song, &lsquo;Love is ever
dying,&rsquo; in his tragedy of the <i>Broken Heart</i>, 1633.</p>

Supererogation</i> (1593, p. 61), after enthusiastic commendation of
Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnets (&lsquo;Petrarch&rsquo;s invention is pure love
itself; Petrarch&rsquo;s elocution pure beauty itself&rsquo;), justifies
the common English practice of imitating them on the ground that &lsquo;all
the noblest Italian, French, and Spanish poets have in their several veins
Petrarchized; and it is no dishonour for the daintiest or divinest Muse to
be his scholar, whom the amiablest invention and beautifullest elocution
acknowledge their master.&rsquo;&nbsp; Both French and English sonnetteers
habitually admit that they are open to the charge of plagiarising
Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnets to Laura (cf. Du Bellay&rsquo;s <i>Les Amours</i>,
ed. Becq de Fouqui&egrave;res, 1876, p. 186, and Daniel&rsquo;s
<i>Delia</i>, Sonnet xxxviii.)&nbsp; The dependent relations in which both
English and French sonnetteers stood to Petrarch may be best realised by
comparing such a popular sonnet of the Italian master as No. ciii. (or in
some editions lxxxviii.) in <i>Sonetti in Vita di M. Laura</i>, beginning
&lsquo;S&rsquo; amor non &egrave;, che dunque &egrave; quel ch&rsquo;
i&rsquo; sento?&rsquo; with a rendering of it into French like that of De
Ba&iuml;f in his <i>Amours de Francine</i> (ed. Becq de Fouqui&egrave;res,
p. 121), beginning, &lsquo;Si ce n&rsquo;est pas Amour, que sent donques
mon c&oelig;ur?&rsquo; or with a rendering of the same sonnet into English
like that by Watson in his <i>Passionate Century</i>, No. v., beginning,
&lsquo;If &rsquo;t bee not love I feele, what is it then?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Imitation of Petrarch is a constant characteristic of the English sonnet
throughout the sixteenth century from the date of the earliest efforts of
Surrey and Wyatt.&nbsp; It is interesting to compare the skill of the early
and late sonnetteers in rendering the Italian master.&nbsp;
Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnet <i>In vita di M. Laura</i> (No. lxxx. or lxxxi.,
beginning &lsquo;Cesare, poi che &lsquo;l traditor d&rsquo; Egitto&rsquo;)
was independently translated both by Sir Thomas Wyatt, about 1530 (ed.
Bell, p. 60), and by Francis Davison in his <i>Poetical Rhapsody</i> (1602,
ed. Bullen, i. 90).&nbsp; Petrarch&rsquo;s sonnet (No. xcv. or cxiii.) was
also rendered independently both by Wyatt (cf. Puttenham&rsquo;s <i>Arte of
English Poesie</i>, ed. Arber, p. 23) and by Drummond of Hawthornden (ed.
Ward, i. 100, 221).</p>

according to his own account, renderings from Petrarch; twelve are from
Serafino dell&rsquo; Aquila (1466-1500); four each come from Strozza, an
Italian poet, and from Ronsard; three from the Italian poet Agnolo
Firenzuola (1493-1548); two each from the French poet, Etienne Forcadel,
known as Forcatulus (1514?-1573), the Italian Girolamo Parabosco
(<i>fl.</i> 1548), and &AElig;neas Sylvius; while many are based on
passages from such authors as (among the Greeks) Sophocles, Theocritus,
Apollonius of Rhodes (author of the epic &lsquo;Argonautica&rsquo;); or
(among the Latins) Virgil, Tibullus, Ovid, Horace, Propertius, Seneca,

between Shakespeare&rsquo;s and Drayton&rsquo;s sonnets which any reader of
the two collections in conjunction could easily increase.&nbsp; Mr. Wyndham
in his valuable edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Sonnets</i>, p. 255,
argues that Drayton was the plagiarist of Shakespeare, chiefly on
bibliographical grounds, which he does not state quite accurately.&nbsp;
One hundred sonnets belonging to Drayton&rsquo;s <i>Idea</i> series are
extant, but they were not all published by him at one time.&nbsp;
Fifty-three were alone included in his first and only separate edition of
1594; six more appeared in a reprint of <i>Idea</i> appended to the
<i>Heroical Epistles</i> in 1599; twenty-four of these were gradually
dropped and thirty-four new ones substituted in reissues appended to
volumes of his writings issued respectively in 1600, 1602, 1603, and
1605.&nbsp; To the collection thus re-formed a further addition of twelve
sonnets and a withdrawal of some twelve old sonnets were made in the final
edition of Drayton&rsquo;s works in 1619.&nbsp; There the sonnets number
sixty-three.&nbsp; Mr. Wyndham insists that Drayton&rsquo;s latest
published sonnets have alone an obvious resemblance to Shakespeare&rsquo;s
sonnets, and that they all more or less reflect Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets
as printed by Thorpe in 1609.&nbsp; But the whole of Drayton&rsquo;s
century of sonnets except twelve were in print long before 1609, and it
could easily be shown that the earliest fifty-three published in 1594
supply as close parallels with Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets as any of the
forty-seven published subsequently.&nbsp; Internal evidence suggests that
all but one or two of Drayton&rsquo;s sonnets were written by him in 1594,
in the full tide of the sonnetteering craze.&nbsp; Almost all were
doubtless in circulation in manuscript then, although only fifty-three were
published in 1594.&nbsp; Shakespeare would have had ready means of access
to Drayton&rsquo;s manuscript collection.&nbsp; Mr. Collier reprinted all
the sonnets that Drayton published between 1594 and 1619 in his edition of
Drayton&rsquo;s poems for the Roxburghe Club, 1856.&nbsp; Other editions of
Drayton&rsquo;s sonnets of this and the last century reprint exclusively
the collection of sixty-three appended to the edition of his works in
1619.</p>

class="footnote">[111]</a>&nbsp; Almost all sixteenth-century sonnets on
spring in the absence of the poet&rsquo;s love (cf. Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Sonnets xcviii., xcix.) are variations on the sentiment and phraseology of
Petrarch&rsquo;s well-known sonnet xlii., &lsquo;In morte di M.
Laura,&rsquo; beginning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zefiro torna e &lsquo;l bel tempo rimena,<br />
&nbsp; E i fiori e l&rsquo;erbe, sua dolce famiglia,<br />

&nbsp; Sospiri, che del cor profondo tragge, &amp;c.</p>

class="footnote">[113a]</a>&nbsp; A similar conceit is the topic of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnet xxiv.&nbsp; Ronsard&rsquo;s Ode (livre iv. No.
xx.) consists of a like dialogue between the heart and the eye.&nbsp; The
conceit is traceable to Petrarch, whose Sonnet lv. or lxiii. (&lsquo;Occhi,
piangete, accompagnate il core&rsquo;) is a dialogue between the poet and
his eyes, while his Sonnet xcix. or cxvii. is a companion dialogue between
the poet and his heart.&nbsp; Cf. Watson&rsquo;s <i>Tears of Fancie</i>,
xix. xx. (a pair of sonnets on the theme which closely resemble
Shakespeare&rsquo;s pair); Drayton&rsquo;s <i>Idea</i>, xxxiii.;
Barnes&rsquo;s <i>Parthenophe and Parthenophil</i>, xx., and
Constable&rsquo;s <i>Diana</i>, vi. 7.</p>
<p><a name="footnote113b"></a><a href="#citation113b"
class="footnote">[113b]</a>&nbsp; The Greek epigram is in <i>Palatine
Anthology</i>, ix. 627, and is translated into Latin in <i>Selecta
Epigrammata</i>, Basel, 1529.&nbsp; The Greek lines relate, as in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets, how a nymph who sought to quench love&rsquo;s
torch in a fountain only succeeded in heating the water.&nbsp; An added
detail Shakespeare borrowed from a very recent adaptation of the epigram in
Giles Fletcher&rsquo;s <i>Licia</i>, 1593 (Sonnet xxvii.), where the
poet&rsquo;s Love bathes in the fountain, with the result not only that
&lsquo;she touched the water and it burnt with Love,&rsquo; but also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now by her means it purchased hath that bliss<br />
Which all diseases quickly can remove.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly Shakespeare in Sonnet cliv. not merely states that the
&lsquo;cool well&rsquo; into which Cupid&rsquo;s torch had fallen
&lsquo;from Love&rsquo;s fire took heat perpetual,&rsquo; but also that it
grew &lsquo;a bath and healthful remedy for men diseased.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="footnote114a"></a><a href="#citation114a"
class="footnote">[114a]</a>&nbsp; In Greek poetry the topic is treated in
Pindar&rsquo;s <i>Olympic Odes</i>, xi., and in a fragment by Sappho, No.
16 in Bergk&rsquo;s <i>Poet&aelig; Lyrici Gr&aelig;ci</i>.&nbsp; In Latin
poetry the topic is treated in Ennius as quoted in Cicero, <i>De
Senectute</i>, c. 207; in Horace&rsquo;s <i>Odes</i>, iii. 30; in
Virgil&rsquo;s <i>Georgics</i>, iii. 9; in Propertius, iii. 1; in
Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, xv. 871 seq.; and in Martial, x. 27
seq.&nbsp; Among French sonnetteers Ronsard attacked the theme most
boldly.&nbsp; His odes and sonnets promise immortality to the persons to
whom they are addressed with an extravagant and a monotonous
liberality.&nbsp; The following lines from Ronsard&rsquo;s Ode (livre i.
No. vii.) &lsquo;Au Seigneur Carnavalet,&rsquo; illustrate his habitual
treatment of the theme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C&rsquo;est un travail de bon-heur<br />
Chanter les hommes louables,<br />
Et leur bastir un honneur<br />
Seul vainqueur des ans muables.<br />
Le marbre ou l&rsquo;airain vestu<br />
D&rsquo;un labeur vif par l&rsquo;enclume<br />
N&rsquo;animent tant la vertu<br />
Que les Muses par la plume. . .</p>
<p>Les neuf divines pucelles<br />
Gardent ta gloire chez elles;<br />
Et mon luth, qu&rsquo;ell&rsquo;ont fait estre<br />
De leurs secrets le grand prestre,<br />
Par cest hymne solennel<br />
Respandra dessus ta race<br />
Je ne s&ccedil;ay quoy de sa grace<br />
Qui te doit faire eternel.</p>
<p>(<i>&OElig;uvres de Ronsard</i>, ed. Blanchemain, ii. 58, 62.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I quote two other instances from Ronsard on p. 116, note 1.&nbsp;
Desportes was also prone to indulge in the same conceit; cf. his
<i>Cleonice</i>, sonnet 62, which Daniel appropriated bodily in his
<i>Delia</i> Sonnet xxvi.)&nbsp; Desportes warns his mistress that she will
live in his verse like the ph&oelig;nix in fire.</p>

note 1.&nbsp; This sonnet is also very like Ronsard&rsquo;s Ode (livre v.
No. xxxii.)&nbsp; &lsquo;A sa Muse,&rsquo; which opens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plus dur que fer j&rsquo;ay fini mon ouvrage,<br />
Que &lsquo;an, dispos &agrave; demener les pas,<br />

Que j&rsquo;ay gaign&eacute;e, annon&ccedil;ant la victoire<br />
Dont &agrave; bon droit je me voy jouissant. . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cf. also Ronsard&rsquo;s Sonnet lxxii. in <i>Amours</i> (livre i.),
where he declares that his mistress&rsquo;s name</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Victorieux des peuples et des rois<br />
S&rsquo;en voleroit sus l&rsquo;aile de ma ryme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Shakespeare, like Ronsard, knew Horace&rsquo;s far-famed Ode (bk.
iii. 30)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exegi monumentum &aelig;re perennius<br />
Regalique situ pyramidum altius,<br />
Quod non imber edax, non Aquilo impotens<br />
Possit diruere, aut innumerabilis<br />
Annorum series, et fuga temporum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor can there be any doubt that Shakespeare wrote with a direct
reference to the concluding nine lines of Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>
(xv. 871-9):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jamque opus exegi, quod nec Jovis ira nec ignes,<br />
Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas.<br />
Cum volet illa dies, qu&aelig; nil nisi corporis hujus<br />
Jus habet, incerti spatium mihi finiat &aelig;vi;<br />
Parte tamen meliore mei super alta perennis<br />
Astra ferar nomenque erit indelebile nostrum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage was familiar to Shakespeare in one of his favourite
books&mdash;Golding&rsquo;s translation of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>.&nbsp;
Golding&rsquo;s rendering opens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now have I brought a worke to end which neither Jove&rsquo;s fierce
wrath<br />
Nor sword nor fire nor fretting age, with all the force it hath<br />
Are able to abolish quite, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meres, after his mention of Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets in his
<i>Palladis Tamia</i> (1598), quotes parts of both passages from Horace and
Ovid, and gives a Latin paraphrase of his own, which, he says, would fit
the lips of our contemporary poets besides Shakespeare.&nbsp; The
introduction of the name Mars into Meres&rsquo;s paraphrase as well as into
line 7 of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnet lv. led Mr. Tyler (on what are in any
case very trivial grounds) to the assumption that Shakespeare was borrowing
from his admiring critic, and was therefore writing after 1598, when
Meres&rsquo;s book was published.&nbsp; In Golding&rsquo;s translation
reference is made to Mars by name (the Latin here calls the god Gradivus) a
few lines above the passage already quoted, and the word caught
Shakespeare&rsquo;s eye there.&nbsp; Shakespeare owed nothing to
Meres&rsquo;s paraphrase, but Meres probably owed much to passages in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets.</p>

Barnes&rsquo;s <i>Parthenophil</i>, sonnet xlviii., &lsquo;Her hairs no

coral is not uncommon outside the Elizabethan sonnet, but it was universal

<p>A conventional sonnet or extravagant vituperation, which Drummond of
Hawthornden translated from Marino (<i>Rime</i>, 1602, pt. i. p. 76), is
introduced with grotesque inappropriateness into Drummond&rsquo;s

addressed to a woman were addressed to the &lsquo;dark lady,&rsquo; and
that the &lsquo;dark lady&rsquo; is identifiable with Mary Fitton, a
mistress of the Earl of Pembroke, are baseless conjectures.&nbsp; The
extant portraits of Mary Fitton prove her to be fair.&nbsp; The
introduction of her name into the discussion is solely due to the mistaken
notion that Shakespeare was the <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Pembroke,
that most of the sonnets were addressed to him, and that the poet was
probably acquainted with his patron&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; See Appendix
VII.&nbsp; The expressions in two of the vituperative sonnets to the effect
that the disdainful mistress had &lsquo;robb&rsquo;d others&rsquo;
beds&rsquo; revenues of their rents&rsquo; (cxlii. 8) and &lsquo;in act her
bed-vow broke&rsquo; (clii. 37) have been held to imply that the woman
denounced by Shakespeare was married.&nbsp; The first quotation can only
mean that she was unfaithful with married men, but both quotations seem to
be general phrases of abuse, the meaning of which should not be pressed
closely.</p>

class="footnote">[135]</a>&nbsp; Much irrelevance has been introduced into
the discussion of Chapman&rsquo;s claim to be the rival poet.&nbsp; Prof.
Minto in his <i>Characteristics of English Poets</i>, p. 291, argued that
Chapman was the man mainly because Shakespeare declared his competitor to
be taught to write by &lsquo;spirits&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;his compeers by
night&rsquo;&mdash;as well as by &lsquo;an affable familiar ghost&rsquo;
which gulled him with intelligence at night (lxxxvi. 5 seq.)&nbsp;
Professor Minto saw in these phrases allusions to some remarks by Chapman
in his <i>Shadows of Night</i> (1594), a poem on Night.&nbsp; There Chapman
warned authors in one passage that the spirit of literature will often
withhold itself from them unless it have &lsquo;drops of their blood like a
heavenly familiar,&rsquo; and in another place sportively invited
&lsquo;nimble and aspiring wits&rsquo; to join him in consecrating their
endeavours to &lsquo;sacred night.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is really no
connection between Shakespeare&rsquo;s theory of the supernatural and
nocturnal sources of his rival&rsquo;s influence and Chapman&rsquo;s trite
allusion to the current faith in the power of &lsquo;nightly
familiars&rsquo; over men&rsquo;s minds and lives, or Chapman&rsquo;s
invitation to his literary comrades to honour Night with him.&nbsp; It is
supererogatory to assume that Shakespeare had Chapman&rsquo;s phrases in
his mind when alluding to superstitions which were universally
acknowledged.&nbsp; It could be as easily argued on like grounds that
Shakespeare was drawing on other authors.&nbsp; Nash in his prose tract
called independently <i>The Terrors of the Night</i>, which was also
printed in 1594, described the nocturnal habits of &lsquo;familiars&rsquo;
more explicitly than Chapman.&nbsp; The publisher Thomas Thorpe, in
dedicating in 1600 Marlowe&rsquo;s translation of Lucan (bk. i.) to his
friend Edward Blount, humorously referred to the same topic when he
reminded Blount that &lsquo;this spirit [<i>i.e.</i> Marlowe], whose ghost
or genius is to be seen walk the Churchyard [of St. Paul&rsquo;s] in at the
least three or four sheets . . . was sometime a <i>familiar</i> of your
own.&rsquo;&nbsp; On the strength of these quotations, and accepting
Professor Minto&rsquo;s line of argument, Nash, Thorpe, or Blount, whose
&lsquo;familiar&rsquo; is declared to have been no less a personage than
Marlowe, has as good a claim as Chapman to be the rival poet of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets.&nbsp; A second and equally impotent argument
in Chapman&rsquo;s favour has been suggested.&nbsp; Chapman in the preface
to his translation of the <i>Iliads</i> (1611 ) denounces without
mentioning any name &lsquo;a certain envious windsucker that hovers up and
down, laboriously engrossing all the air with his luxurious ambition, and
buzzing into every ear my detraction.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is suggested that
Chapman here retaliated on Shakespeare for his references to him as his
rival in the sonnets; but it is out of the question that Chapman, were he
the rival, should have termed those high compliments
&lsquo;detraction.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is no ground for identifying
Chapman&rsquo;s &lsquo;windsucker&rsquo; with Shakespeare (cf. Wyndham, p.
255).&nbsp; The strongest point in favour of the theory of Chapman&rsquo;s
identity with the rival poet lies in the fact that each of the two sections
of his poem <i>The Shadow of the Night</i> (1594) is styled a
&lsquo;hymn,&rsquo; and Shakespeare in Sonnet lxxxv. 6-7 credits his rival
with writing &lsquo;hymns.&rsquo;&nbsp; But Drayton, in his <i>Harmonie of
the Church</i>, 1591, and Barnes, as we have just seen, both wrote
&lsquo;hymns.&rsquo;&nbsp; The word was not loosely used in Elizabethan
English, as in sixteenth-century French, in the general sense of
&lsquo;poem.&rsquo;</p>

his aged sovereign thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, hopeful love, my object and invention,<br />
&nbsp;  Oh, true desire, the spur of my conceit,<br />
Oh, worthiest spirit, my mind&rsquo;s impulsion,<br />
&nbsp;  Oh, eyes transparent, my affection&rsquo;s bait;<br />
Oh, princely form, my fancy&rsquo;s adamant,<br />
&nbsp;  Divine conceit, my pain&rsquo;s acceptance,<br />
Oh, all in one!&nbsp; Oh, heaven on earth transparent!<br />
&nbsp;  The seat of joy and love&rsquo;s abundance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Cf. <i>Cynthia</i>, a fragment in <i>Poems of Raleigh</i>, ed. Hannah,
p. 33.) When Ralegh leaves Elizabeth&rsquo;s presence he tell us his
&lsquo;forsaken heart&rsquo; and his &lsquo;withered mind&rsquo; were
&lsquo;widowed of all the joys&rsquo; they &lsquo;once
possessed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Only some 500 lines (the twenty-first book and a
fragment of another book) survive of Ralegh&rsquo;s poem <i>Cynthia</i>,
the whole of which was designed to prove his loyalty to the Queen, and all
the extant lines are in the same vein as those I quote.&nbsp; The complete
poem extended to twenty-two books, and the lines exceeded 10,000, or five
times as many as in Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets.&nbsp; Richard Barnfield in
his like-named poem of <i>Cynthia</i>, 1595, and Fulke Greville in sonnets
addressed to Cynthia, also extravagantly described the Queen&rsquo;s beauty
and graces.&nbsp; In 1599 Sir John Davies, poet and lawyer, apostrophised
Elizabeth, who was then sixty-six years old, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fair soul, since to the fairest body knit<br />
You give such lively life, such quickening power,<br />
Such sweet celestial influences to it<br />
As keeps it still in youth&rsquo;s immortal flower . . .<br />
O many, many years may you remain<br />
A happy angel to this happy land (<i>Nosce Teipsum</i>, dedication).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davies published in the same year twenty-six &lsquo;Hymnes of
Astrea&rsquo; on Elizabeth&rsquo;s beauty and graces; each poem forms an
acrostic on the words &lsquo;Elizabetha Regina,&rsquo; and the language of
love is simulated on almost every page.</p>

class="footnote">[138b]</a>&nbsp; Adulatory sonnets to patrons are met with
in the preliminary or concluding pages of numerous sixteenth and
seventeenth century books (<i>e.g.</i> the collection of sonnets addressed
to James VI of Scotland in his <i>Essayes of a Prentise</i>, 1591, and the
sonnets to noblemen before Spenser&rsquo;s <i>Faerie Queene</i>, at the end
of Chapman&rsquo;s <i>Iliad</i>, and at the end of John Davies&rsquo;s
<i>Microcosmos</i>, 1603).&nbsp; Other sonnets to patrons are scattered
through collections of occasional poems, such as Ben Jonson&rsquo;s
<i>Forest</i> and <i>Underwoods</i> and Donne&rsquo;s <i>Poems</i>.&nbsp;
Sonnets addressed to men are not only found in the preliminary pages, but
are occasionally interpolated in sonnet-sequences of fictitious love.&nbsp;
Sonnet xi. in Drayton&rsquo;s sonnet-fiction called &lsquo;Idea&rsquo; (in
1599 edition) seems addressed to a man, in much the same manner as
Shakespeare often addressed his hero; and a few others of Drayton&rsquo;s
sonnets are ambiguous as to the sex of their subject.&nbsp; John
Soothern&rsquo;s eccentric collection of love-sonnets, <i>Pandora</i>
(1584), has sonnets dedicatory to the Earl of Oxford; and William Smith in
his <i>Chloris</i> (1596) (a sonnet-fiction of the conventional kind) in
two prefatory sonnets and in No. xlix. of the substantive collection
invokes the affectionate notice of Edmund Spenser.&nbsp; Throughout Europe
&lsquo;dedicatory&rsquo; sonnets or poems to women betray identical
characteristics to those that were addressed to men.&nbsp; The poetic
addresses to the Countess of Bedford and other noble patronesses of Donne,
Ben Jonson, and their colleagues are always affectionate, often amorous, in
their phraseology, and akin in temper to Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets of
friendship.&nbsp; Nicholas Breton, in his poem <i>The Pilgrimage to
Paradise coyned with the Countess of Pembroke&rsquo;s Love</i>, 1592, and
another work of his, <i>The Countess of Pembroke&rsquo;s Passion</i> (first
printed from manuscript in 1867), pays the Countess, who was merely his
literary patroness, a homage which is indistinguishable from the ecstatic
utterances of a genuine and overmastering passion.&nbsp; The difference in
the sex of the persons addressed by Breton and by Shakespeare seems to
place their poems in different categories, but they both really belonged to
the same class.&nbsp; They both merely display a
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s</i> loyalty to his patron, couched,
according to current convention, in the strongest possible terms of
personal affection.&nbsp; In Italy and France exactly the same vocabulary
of adoration was applied by authors indifferently to patrons and
patronesses.&nbsp; It is known that one series of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s
impassioned sonnets was addressed to a young nobleman Tommaso dei
Cavalieri, and another series to a noble patroness Vittoria Colonna, but
the tone is the same in both, and internal evidence fails to enable the
critic to distinguish between the two series.&nbsp; Only one English
contemporary of Shakespeare published a long series of sonnets addressed to
a man who does not prove on investigation to have been a professional
patron.&nbsp; In 1595 Richard Barnfield appended to his poem <i>Cynthia</i>
a set of twenty sonnets, in which he feignedly avowed affection for a youth
called Ganymede.&nbsp; These poems do not belong to the same category as
Shakespeare&rsquo;s, but to the category of sonnet-sequences of love in
which it was customary to invoke a fictitious mistress.&nbsp; Barnfield
explained that in his sonnets he attempted a variation on the conventional
practice by fancifully adapting to the sonnet-form the second of
Virgil&rsquo;s <i>Eclogues</i>, in which the shepherd Corydon apostrophises
the shepherd-boy Alexis.</p>

In 1760 mention is made of it in a letter of thanks in the

corporation of Stratford for presenting him with a standish made from the
wood.&nbsp; But, according to the testimony of old inhabitants confided to
Malone (cf. his <i>Life of Shakespeare</i>, 1790, p. 118), the legend had
been orally current in Stratford since Shakespeare&rsquo;s lifetime.&nbsp;
The tree was perhaps planted in 1609, when a Frenchman named Veron
distributed a number of young mulberry trees through the midland counties
by order of James I, who desired to encourage the culture of silkworms (cf.

other necessaries of life&mdash;meat, milk, eggs, wool, building materials,

price of these commodities and the comparatively high price of corn, the
average price of necessaries will be found to be in Shakespeare&rsquo;s day
about an eighth of what it is now.&nbsp; The cost of luxuries is also now
about eight times the price that it was in the sixteenth or seventeenth
century.&nbsp; Sixpence was the usual price of a new quarto or octavo book
such as would now be sold at prices ranging between three shillings and
sixpence and six shillings.&nbsp; Half a crown was charged for the

set down and prescribed about a year and a half since.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
nothing followed, and no more was heard officially of the Council&rsquo;s

seemed to have infected all the London theatres.&nbsp; On May 10, 1601, the
Privy Council called the attention of the Middlesex magistrates to the
abuse covertly levelled by the actors of the &lsquo;Curtain&rsquo; at
gentlemen &lsquo;of good desert and quality,&rsquo; and directed the
magistrates to examine all plays before they were produced (<i>Privy
Council Register</i>).&nbsp; Jonson subsequently issued an
&lsquo;apologetical dialogue&rsquo; (appended to printed copies of the
<i>Poetaster</i>), in which he somewhat truculently qualified his hostility
to the players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Now for the players &rsquo;tis true I tax&rsquo;d them<br />
And yet but some, and those so sparingly<br />
As all the rest might have sat still unquestioned,<br />
Had they but had the wit or conscience<br />
To think well of themselves.&nbsp; But impotent they<br />
Thought each man&rsquo;s vice belonged to their whole tribe;<br />
And much good do it them.&nbsp; What they have done against me<br />
I am not moved with, if it gave them meat<br />

<p><a name="footnote220"></a><a href="#citation220"
class="footnote">[220]</a>&nbsp; The most scornful criticism that Jonson is
known to have passed on any composition by Shakespeare was aimed at a
passage in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>, and as Jonson&rsquo;s attack is
barely justifiable on literary grounds, it is fair to assume that the play
was distasteful to him from other considerations.&nbsp; &lsquo;Many
times,&rsquo; Jonson wrote of Shakespeare in his <i>Timber</i>, &lsquo;hee
fell into those things [which] could not escape laughter: As when hee said
in the person of <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, one speaking to him [<i>i.e.</i>
C&aelig;sar]; <i>C&aelig;sar</i>, <i>thou dost me wrong</i>.&nbsp; Hee
[<i>i.e.</i> C&aelig;sar] replyed: <i>C&aelig;sar did never wrong</i>,
<i>butt with just cause</i>: and such like, which were
ridiculous.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jonson derisively quoted the same passage in the
induction to <i>The Staple of News</i> (1625): &lsquo;Cry you mercy, you
did not wrong but with just cause.&rsquo;&nbsp; Possibly the words that
were ascribed by Jonson to Shakespeare&rsquo;s character of
<i>C&aelig;sar</i> appeared in the original version of the play, but owing
perhaps to Jonson&rsquo;s captious criticism they do not figure in the
Folio version, the sole version that has reached us.&nbsp; The only words
there that correspond with Jonson&rsquo;s quotation are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
remark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Know, C&aelig;sar doth not wrong, nor without cause<br />
Will he be satisfied</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(III. i. 47-8).&nbsp; The rhythm and sense seem to require the
reinsertion after the word &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; of the phrase &lsquo;but
with just cause,&rsquo; which Jonson needlessly reprobated.&nbsp; Leonard
Digges (1588-1635), one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s admiring critics, emphasises
the superior popularity of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> in
the theatre to Ben Jonson&rsquo;s Roman play of <i>Catiline</i>, in his
eulogistic lines on Shakespeare (published after Digges&rsquo;s death in
the 1640 edition of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Poems</i>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So have I seen when C&aelig;sar would appear,<br />
And on the stage at half-sword parley were<br />
Brutus and Cassius&mdash;oh, how the audience<br />
Were ravish&rsquo;d, with what wonder they went thence<br />
When some new day they would not brook a line<br />
Of tedious, though well laboured, Catiline.</p>

class="footnote">[221]</a>&nbsp; I wrote on this point in the article on
Thomas Kyd in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> (vol. xxxi.):
&lsquo;The argument in favour of Kyd&rsquo;s authorship of a
pre-Shakespearean play (now lost) on the subject of Hamlet deserves
attention.&nbsp; Nash in 1589, when describing [in his preface to
<i>Menaphon</i>] the typical literary hack, who at almost every point
suggests Kyd, notices that in addition to his other accomplishments
&ldquo;he will afford you whole Hamlets, I should say handfuls of tragical
speeches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other references in popular tracts and plays of like
date prove that in an early tragedy concerning Hamlet there was a ghost who
cried repeatedly, &ldquo;Hamlet, revenge!&rdquo; and that this expression
took rank in Elizabethan slang beside the vernacular quotations from
[Kyd&rsquo;s sanguinary tragedy of] <i>Jeronimo</i>, such as &ldquo;What
outcry calls me from my naked bed,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beware, Hieronimo, go
by, go by.&rdquo;&nbsp; The resemblance between the stories of
<i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Jeronimo</i> suggests that the former would have
supplied Kyd with a congenial plot.&nbsp; In <i>Jeronimo</i> a father seeks
to avenge his son&rsquo;s murder; in <i>Hamlet</i> the theme is the same
with the position of father and son reversed.&nbsp; In <i>Jeronimo</i> the
avenging father resolves to reach his end by arranging for the performance
of a play in the presence of those whom he suspects of the murder of his
son, and there is good ground for crediting the lost tragedy of
<i>Hamlet</i> with a similar play-scene.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s debt to
the lost tragedy is a matter of conjecture, but the stilted speeches of the
play-scene in his <i>Hamlet</i> read like intentional parodies of
Kyd&rsquo;s bombastic efforts in <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>, and it is
quite possible that they were directly suggested by an almost identical
episode in a lost <i>Hamlet</i> by the same author.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Shakespeare elsewhere shows acquaintance with Kyd&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; He
places in the mouth of Kit Sly in the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> the
current phrase &lsquo;Go by, Jeronimy,&rsquo; from <i>The Spanish
Tragedy</i>.&nbsp; Shakespeare quotes verbatim a line from the same piece
in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> (I. i. 271): &lsquo;In time the savage
bull doth bear the yoke;&rsquo; but Kyd practically borrowed that line from
Watson&rsquo;s <i>Passionate Centurie</i> (No. xlvii.), where Shakespeare
may have met it.</p>

has been made by Mr. F. G. Fleay and Mr. George Wyndham to treat <i>Troilus
and Cressida</i> as Shakespeare&rsquo;s contribution to the embittered
controversy of 1601-2, between Jonson on the one hand and Marston and
Dekker and their actor friends on the other hand, and to represent the play
as a pronouncement against Jonson.&nbsp; According to this fanciful view,
Shakespeare held up Jonson to savage ridicule in Ajax, while in Thersites
he denounced Marston, despite Marston&rsquo;s intermittent antagonism to
Jonson, which entitled him to freedom from attack by Jonson&rsquo;s
foes.&nbsp; The appearance of the word &lsquo;mastic&rsquo; in the line (1.
iii. 73) &lsquo;When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws&rsquo; is treated
as proof of Shakespeare&rsquo;s identification of Thersites with Marston,
who used the pseudonym &lsquo;Therio-mastix&rsquo; in his <i>Scourge of
Villainy</i>.&nbsp; It would be as reasonable to identify him with Dekker,
who wrote the greater part of <i>Satiro-mastix</i>.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mastic&rsquo; is doubtless an adjective formed without recondite
significance from the substantive &lsquo;mastic,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i> the gum
commonly used at the time for stopping decayed teeth.&nbsp; No hypothesis
of a polemical intention is needed to account for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
conception of Ajax or Thersites.&nbsp; There is no trait in either
character as depicted by Shakespeare which a reading of Chapman&rsquo;s
<i>Homer</i> would fail to suggest.&nbsp; The controversial interpretation
of the play is in conflict with chronology (for <i>Troilus</i> cannot, on
any showing, be assigned to the period of the war between Jonson and
Dekker, in 1601-2), and it seems confuted by the facts and arguments
already adduced in the discussion of the theatrical conflict (see pp.
213-219).&nbsp; If more direct disproof be needed, it may be found in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s prologue to <i>Troilus</i>, where there is a
good-humoured and expressly pacific allusion to the polemical aims of
Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Poetaster</i>.&nbsp; Jonson had introduced into his play
&lsquo;an <i>armed</i> prologue&rsquo; on account, he asserted, of his
enemies&rsquo; menaces.&nbsp; Shakespeare, after describing in his prologue
to <i>Troilus</i> the progress of the Trojan war before his story opened,
added that his &lsquo;prologue&rsquo; presented itself
&lsquo;<i>arm&rsquo;d</i>,&rsquo; not to champion &lsquo;author&rsquo;s pen
or actor&rsquo;s voice,&rsquo; but simply to announce in a guise befitting
the warlike subject-matter that the play began in the middle of the
conflict between Greek and Trojan, and not at the beginning.&nbsp; These
words of Shakespeare put out of court any interpretation of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s play that would represent it as a contribution to the
theatrical controversy.</p>

plays performed at Court in 1604 and 1605 which is among Malone&rsquo;s
manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, and was obviously derived by Malone
from authentic documents that were in his day preserved at the Audit Office
in Somerset House.&nbsp; The document cannot now be traced at the Public
Record Office, whither the Audit Office papers have been removed since
Malone&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Peter Cunningham professed to print the
original document in his accounts of the revels at Court (Shakespeare
Society, 1842, pp. 203 <i>et seq.</i>), but there is no doubt that he
forged his so-called transcript, and that the additions which he made to
Malone&rsquo;s memorandum were the outcome of his fancy.&nbsp;
Collier&rsquo;s assertion in his <i>New Particulars</i>, p. 57, that
<i>Othello</i> was first acted at Sir Thomas Egerton&rsquo;s residence at
Harefield on August 6, 1602, was based solely on a document among the Earl
of Ellesmere&rsquo;s MSS. at Bridgwater House, which purported to be a
contemporary account by the clerk, Sir Arthur Maynwaring, of Sir Thomas
Egerton&rsquo;s household expenses.&nbsp; This document, which Collier
reprinted in his <i>Egerton Papers</i> (Camden Soc.), p. 343, was
authoritatively pronounced by experts in 1860 to be &lsquo;a shameful
forgery&rsquo; (cf. Ingleby&rsquo;s <i>Complete View of the Shakspere

some by Shakespeare were beyond doubt amongst them, and possibly &lsquo;The

Cunningham&rsquo;s <i>Extracts from the Revels&rsquo; Accounts</i>, p. 210,
supplies among other entries two to the effect that &lsquo;The

November 1) 1611 and that &lsquo;A Winter&rsquo;s Tale&rsquo; followed four
days later, on November 5.&nbsp; Though these entries are fictitious, the
information they offer may be true.&nbsp; Malone doubtless based his
positive statement respecting the date of the composition of &lsquo;The
Tempest&rsquo; in 1611 on memoranda made from papers then accessible at the
Audit Office, but now, since the removal of those archives to the Public
Record Office, mislaid.&nbsp; All the forgeries introduced into the
Revels&rsquo; accounts are well considered and show expert knowledge (see

other stuff wherewith one of them was stopped, did light on the Thatch,
where being thought at first but an idle Smoak, and their eyes more
attentive to the show, it kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train,
consuming within less than an hour the whole House to the very
grounds.&nbsp; This was the fatal period of that vertuous fabrique; wherein
yet nothing did perish, but wood and straw and a few forsaken cloaks; only
one man had his breeches set on fire, that would perhaps have broyled him,
if he had not by the benefit of a provident wit put it out with bottle[d]

1613, briefly mentions that the theatre was burnt to the ground in less

the firing of cannon &lsquo;to be used in the play.&rsquo;&nbsp; The

Mr. Herbert Mackay, and there is no doubt that Shakespeare barred the
dower.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Mackay&rsquo;s opinion is couched in the following
terms: &lsquo;The conveyance of the Blackfriars estate to William
Shakespeare in 1613 shows that the estate was conveyed to Shakespeare,
Johnson, Jackson, and Hemming as joint tenants, and therefore the dower of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s wife would be barred unless he were the survivor of the
four bargainees.&rsquo;&nbsp; That was a remote contingency, which did not
arise, and Shakespeare always retained the power of making &lsquo;another
settlement when the trustees were shrinking.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thus the bar was
for practical purposes perpetual, and disposes of Mr.

identified with Shakespeare, and it would be futile to attempt to make the
record of the pretended portraits complete.&nbsp; Upwards of sixty have
been offered for sale to the National Portrait Gallery since its foundation
in 1856, and not one of these has proved to possess the remotest claim to
authenticity.&nbsp; The following are some of the wholly unauthentic
portraits that have attracted public attention: Three portraits assigned to
Zucchero, who left England in 1580, and cannot have had any relations with
Shakespeare&mdash;one in the Art Museum, Boston, U.S.A.; another, formerly
the property of Richard Cosway, R.A., and afterwards of Mr. J. A. Langford
of Birmingham (engraved in mezzotint by H. Green); and a third belonging to
the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, who purchased it in 1862.&nbsp; At Hampton
Court is a wholly unauthentic portrait of the Chandos type, which was at
one time at Penshurst; it bears the legend &lsquo;&AElig;tatis su&aelig;
34&rsquo; (cf. Law&rsquo;s <i>Cat. of Hampton Court</i>, p. 234).&nbsp; A
portrait inscribed &lsquo;&aelig;tatis su&aelig; 47, 1611,&rsquo; belonging
to Clement Kingston of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was engraved in mezzotint by
G. F. Storm in 1846.</p>

Excellence by men of unquestion&rsquo;d parts as this I now express of him,

he wou&rsquo;d shew all the Poets of Antiquity outdone by Shakespear, in
all the Topics, and common places made use of in Poetry.&nbsp; The Enemies
of Shakespear wou&rsquo;d by no means yield him so much Excellence: so that
it came to a Resolution of a trial of skill upon that Subject; the place
agreed on for the Dispute was Mr. Hales&rsquo;s Chamber at Eaton; a great
many Books were sent down by the Enemies of this Poet, and on the appointed
day my Lord Falkland, Sir John Suckling, and all the Persons of Quality
that had Wit and Learning, and interested themselves in the Quarrel, met
there, and upon a thorough Disquisition of the point, the Judges chose by
agreement out of this Learned and Ingenious Assembly unanimously gave the
Preference to Shakespear.&nbsp; And the Greek and Roman Poets were
adjudg&rsquo;d to Vail at least their Glory in that of the English

class="footnote">[370]</a>&nbsp; Most of those that are commonly quoted are
phrases in ordinary use by all writers of the day.&nbsp; The only point of
any interest raised in the argument from parallelisms of expression centres
about a quotation from Aristotle which Bacon and Shakespeare not merely
both make, but make in what looks at a first glance to be the same
erroneous form.&nbsp; Aristotle wrote in his <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>, i.
8, that young men were unfitted for the study of <i>political</i>
philosophy.&nbsp; Bacon, in the <i>Advancement of Learning</i> (1605),
wrote: &lsquo;Is not the opinion of Aristotle worthy to be regarded wherein
he saith that young men are not fit auditors of <i>moral</i>
philosophy?&rsquo; (bk. ii. p. 255, ed. Kitchin).&nbsp; Shakespeare, about
1603, in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, II. ii. 166, wrote of &lsquo;young
men whom Aristotle thought unfit to hear <i>moral</i>
philosophy.&rsquo;&nbsp; But the alleged error of substituting <i>moral</i>
for <i>political</i> philosophy in Aristotle&rsquo;s text is more apparent
than real.&nbsp; By &lsquo;political&rsquo; philosophy Aristotle, as his
context amply shows, meant the ethics of civil society, which are hardly
distinguishable from what is commonly called &lsquo;morals.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
the summary paraphrase of Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Ethics</i> which was
translated into English from the Italian, and published in 1547, the
passage to which both Shakespeare and Bacon refer is not rendered
literally, but its general drift is given as a warning that moral
philosophy is not a fit subject for study by youths who are naturally
passionate and headstrong.&nbsp; Such an interpretation of
Aristotle&rsquo;s language is common among sixteenth and seventeenth
century writers.&nbsp; Erasmus, in the epistle at the close of his popular
<i>Colloquia</i> (Florence, 1530, sig. Q Q), wrote of his endeavour to
insinuate serious precepts &lsquo;into the minds of young men whom
Aristotle rightly described as unfit auditors of moral philosophy&rsquo;
(&lsquo;in animos adolescentium, quos recte scripsit Aristoteles inidoneos
auditores ethic&aelig; philosophi&aelig;&rsquo;).&nbsp; In a French
translation of the <i>Ethics</i> by the Comte de Plessis, published at
Paris in 1553, the passage is rendered &lsquo;parquoy le ieune enfant
n&rsquo;est suffisant auditeur de la science civile;&rsquo; and an English
commentator (in a manuscript note written about 1605 in a copy of the book
in the British Museum) turned the sentence into English thus:
&lsquo;Whether a young man may bee a fitte scholler of <i>morall</i>
philosophie.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1622 an Italian essayist, Virgilio Malvezzi,
in his preface to his <i>Discorsi sopra Cornelio Tacito</i>, has the
remark, &lsquo;E non &egrave; discordante da questa mia opinione
Aristotele, it qual dice, che i giovani non sono buoni ascultatori delle
<i>morali</i>&rsquo; (cf. Spedding, <i>Works of Bacon</i>, i. 739, iii.
440).</p>

that the Earl of Pembroke was Southampton&rsquo;s &lsquo;most feared

referring to the father of that third Earl of Pembroke who, despite the

Abraham Fraunce&rsquo;s two renderings of Tasso&rsquo;s
<i>Aminta</i>&mdash;one direct from the Italian and the other from the

the Earl of Derby in his <i>Colin Clouts come Home againe</i> (1595); and
some critics assume that Nash referred in <i>Pierce Pennilesse</i> to that
nobleman rather than to Southampton.&nbsp; But Nash&rsquo;s comparison of
his paragon to Ganymede suggests extreme youth, and Southampton was
nineteen in 1592 while Derby was thirty-three.&nbsp; &lsquo;Amyntas&rsquo;
as a complimentary designation was widely used by the poets, and was not
applied exclusively to any one patron of letters.&nbsp; It was bestowed on

authors, and their works were sought after by almost all the publishers of

particular care with Jonson&rsquo;s books, but none of Jonson&rsquo;s works
fell into Thorpe&rsquo;s hands before 1605 or after 1608, a minute fraction
of Jonson&rsquo;s literary life.&nbsp; It is significant that the
author&rsquo;s dedication&mdash;the one certain mark of publication with
the author&rsquo;s sanction&mdash;appears in only one of the three plays by
Chapman that Thorpe issued, viz. in <i>Byron</i>.&nbsp; One or two copies

vertuous ladie, the Ladie M. H.&rsquo;&nbsp; This volume, published in the

of the generous freedom with which initials were scattered over the

awkwardly describes the subject-matter as &lsquo;a desired citie sure in
heaven,&rsquo; and assigns to &lsquo;St. Augustine and his commentator
Vives&rsquo; a &lsquo;savour of the secular.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the same year,
in dedicating <i>Epictetus his Manuall</i> to Florio, he bombastically
pronounces the book to be &lsquo;the hand to philosophy; the instrument of
instruments; as Nature greatest in the least; as Homer&rsquo;s <i>Ilias</i>
in a nutshell; in lesse compasse more cunning.&rsquo;&nbsp; For other

only parallel to Thorpe&rsquo;s salutation of happiness is met with in
George Wither&rsquo;s <i>Abuses Whipt and Stript</i> (London, 1613).&nbsp;
There the dedicatory epistle is prefaced by the ironical salutation
&lsquo;To himselfe G. W. wisheth all happinesse.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is further
asserted that Wither had probably Thorpe&rsquo;s dedication to &lsquo;Mr.
W. H.&rsquo; in view when he wrote that satirical sentence.&nbsp; It will
now be recognised that Wither aimed very gently at no identifiable book,
but at a feature common to scores of books.&nbsp; Since his <i>Abuses</i>
was printed by George Eld and sold by Francis Burton&mdash;the printer and
publisher concerned in 1606 in the publication of &lsquo;W.
H.&rsquo;s&rsquo; Southwell manuscript&mdash;there is a bare chance that
Wither had in mind &lsquo;W. H.&rsquo;s&rsquo; greeting of Mathew Saunders,

indifferently spells his name), entered on the first page of the manuscript
in his own handwriting an &lsquo;epistel dedicatorie&rsquo; which he
confined to the conventional greeting of happiness here and
hereafter.&nbsp; The words ran: &lsquo;To the right worshipfull Mr. Thomas

loose diction of pretentious bombast which it is difficult to interpret
exactly.&nbsp; When dedicating in 1610&mdash;the year after the issue of
the <i>Sonnets</i>&mdash;Healey&rsquo;s <i>Epictetus his Manuall</i>
&lsquo;to a true fauorer of forward spirits, Maister John Florio,&rsquo;
Thorpe writes of Epictetus&rsquo;s work: &lsquo;In all languages, ages, by
all persons high prized, imbraced, yea inbosomed.&nbsp; It filles not the
hand with leaues, but fills ye head with lessons: nor would bee held in
hand but had by harte to boote.&nbsp; He is more senceless than a stocke
that hath no good sence of this stoick.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the same year, when
dedicating Healey&rsquo;s translation of St. Augustine&rsquo;s <i>Citie of
God</i> to the Earl of Pembroke, Thorpe clumsily refers to Pembroke&rsquo;s
patronage of Healey&rsquo;s earlier efforts in translation thus: &lsquo;He
that against detraction beyond expectation, then found your sweete
patronage in a matter of small moment without distrust or disturbance, in
this work of more weight, as he approoued his more abilitie, so would not

Boswell the younger, who, like his master, was a bibliographical expert of

commentators&mdash;men like Malone and Steevens&mdash;who were thoroughly
well versed in the literary history of the sixteenth century, should have
failed to recognise any connection between &lsquo;Mr. W. H.&rsquo; and
Shakespeare&rsquo;s personal history is in itself a very strong argument

biographer of Kemble and Mrs. Siddons, was the first to suggest the
Pembroke theory in a letter to the <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</i> in
1832.&nbsp; A few months later Mr. James Heywood Bright wrote to the
magazine claiming to have reached the same conclusion as early as 1819,
although he had not published it.&nbsp; Boaden re-stated the Pembroke
theory in a volume on <i>Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets</i> which he published
in 1837.&nbsp; C. Armitage Brown adopted it in 1838 in his
<i>Shakespeare&rsquo;s Autobiographical Poems</i>.&nbsp; The Rev. Joseph
Hunter, who accepted the theory without qualification, significantly
pointed out in his <i>New Illustrations of Shakespeare</i> in 1845 (ii.
346) that it had not occurred to any of the writers in the great Variorum
editions of Shakespeare, nor to critics so acute in matters of literary
history as Malone or George Chalmers.&nbsp; The theory is treated as proved
fact in many recent literary manuals.&nbsp; Of its supporters at the date
of writing the most ardent is Mr. Thomas Tyler, who published an edition of
the sonnets in 1890, and there further advanced a claim to identify the
&lsquo;dark lady&rsquo; of the sonnets with Mary Fitton, a lady of the
Court and the Earl of Pembroke&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; Mr. Tyler has
endeavoured to substantiate both the Pembroke and the Fitton theories, by
merely repeating his original arguments, in a pamphlet which appeared in
April of this year under the title of <i>The Herbert-Fitton Theory</i>:
<i>a Reply</i> [<i>i.e.</i> to criticisms of the theories by Lady Newdegate
and by myself].&nbsp; The Pembroke theory, whose adherents have dwindled of
late, will henceforth be relegated, I trust, to the category of popular
delusions.</p>

politics, and was knighted and created Lord Buckhurst.&nbsp; Very late in

signature, &lsquo;M. [<i>i.e.</i> Mr.] Sackville,&rsquo; were reprinted
with that signature unaltered in an encyclop&aelig;dic anthology,

of him, in 1600, after he had become Baron Buckhurst.&nbsp; About the same
date he was similarly designated Thomas or Mr. Sackville in a reprint,
unauthorised by him, of his <i>Induction</i> to <i>The Mirror for
Magistrates</i>, which was in the original text ascribed, with perfect
correctness, to Thomas or Mr. Sackville.&nbsp; There is clearly no sort of

lately sprung up at Wilton to the effect that a letter once existed there
in which the Countess of Pembroke bade her son the earl while he was in
attendance on James I at Salisbury bring the King to Wilton to witness a
performance of <i>As You Like It</i>.&nbsp; The countess is said to have
added, &lsquo;We have the man Shakespeare with us.&rsquo;&nbsp; No tangible
evidence of the existence of the letter is forthcoming, and its tenor
stamps it, if it exists, as an ignorant invention.&nbsp; The circumstances
under which both King and players visited Wilton in 1603 are completely
misrepresented.&nbsp; The Court temporarily occupied Wilton House, and
Shakespeare and his comrades were ordered by the officers of the royal
household to give a performance there in the same way as they would have
been summoned to play before the King had he been at Whitehall.&nbsp; It is
hardly necessary to add that the Countess of Pembroke&rsquo;s mode of
referring to literary men is well known: she treated them on terms of
equality, and could not in any aberration of mind or temper have referred
to Shakespeare as &lsquo;the man Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; Similarly, the
present Earl of Pembroke purchased of a London picture-dealer last year
what purported to be a portrait of the third Earl of Pembroke, and on the
back was pasted a paper, that was represented to date from the seventeenth
century, containing some lines from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnet lxxxi.
(9-14), subscribed with the words &lsquo;Shakespeare unto the Earl of
Pembroke, 1603&rsquo;&nbsp; The ink and handwriting are quite modern, and
hardly make pretence to be of old date in the eyes of any one accustomed to
study manuscripts.&nbsp; On May 5 of this year some persons interested in
the matter, including myself, examined the portrait and the inscription, on
the kind invitation of the present Earl, and the inscription was
unanimously declared by palmographical experts to be a clumsy forgery
unworthy of serious notice.</p>

said above (p. 123), to consider seriously the suggestion that the
&lsquo;dark lady&rsquo; of the sonnets was Mary Fitton, maid of honour to
Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; This frolicsome lady, who was at one time
Pembroke&rsquo;s mistress and bore him a child, has been introduced into a
discussion of the sonnets only on the assumption that her lover, Pembroke,
was the youth to whom the sonnets were addressed.&nbsp; Lady
Newdegate&rsquo;s recently published <i>Gossip from a Muniment Room</i>,
which furnishes for the first time a connected biography of
Pembroke&rsquo;s mistress, adequately disposes of any lingering hope that
Shakespeare may have commemorated her in his black-complexioned
heroine.&nbsp; Lady Newdegate states that two well-preserved portraits of
Mary Fitton remain at Arbury, and that they reveal a lady of fair
complexion with brown hair and grey eyes.&nbsp; Family history places the
authenticity of the portraits beyond doubt, and the endeavour lately made
by Mr. Tyler, the chief champion of the hopeless Fitton theory, to dispute
their authenticity is satisfactorily met by Mr. C. O. Bridgeman in an
appendix to the second edition of Lady Newdegate&rsquo;s book.&nbsp; We
also learn from Lady Newdegate&rsquo;s volume that Miss Fitton, during her
girlhood, was pestered by the attentions of a middle-aged admirer, a
married friend of the family, Sir William Knollys.&nbsp; It has been lamely
suggested by some of the supporters of the Pembroke theory that Sir William
Knollys was one of the persons named Will who are alleged to be noticed as
competitors with Shakespeare and the supposititious &lsquo;Will
Herbert&rsquo; for &lsquo;the dark lady&rsquo;s&rsquo; favours in the
sonnets (cxxxv., cxxxvi., and perhaps clxiii.)&nbsp; But that is a shot
wholly out of range.&nbsp; The wording of those sonnets, when it is
thoroughly tested, proves beyond reasonable doubt that the poet was the
only lover named Will who is represented as courting the disdainful lady of
the sonnets, and that no reference whatever is made there to any other
person of that Christian name.</p>

own, <i>Will</i>,&rsquo; and thence is deduced the argument that the friend
could only be identical with one who, like William Earl of Pembroke, bore
that Christian name.</p>

in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries made an effort to italicise
proper names, unfamiliar words, and words deemed worthy of special
emphasis.&nbsp; But they did not strictly adhere to these rules, and, while
they often failed to italicise the words that deserved italicisation, they
freely italicised others that did not merit it.&nbsp; Capital initial
letters were employed with like irregularity.&nbsp; Mr. Wyndham in his
careful note on the typography of the quarto of 1609 (pp. 259 seq.)
suggests that Elizabethan printers were not erratic in their uses of
italics or capital letters, but an examination of a very large number of
Elizabethan and Jacobean books has brought me to an exactly opposite
conclusion.</p>

resemblance between the <i>graces</i> of his cruel mistress&rsquo;s face
and the <i>Graces</i> of classical mythology, Barnes develops the topic in
the next sonnet after this manner (the italics are my own):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did rich Nature <i>graces</i> grant to thee,<br />
Since thou art such a niggard of thy <i>grace</i>?<br />
O how can <i>graces</i> in thy body be?<br />

boot&rsquo; is a reference to the Christian name of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
friend, &lsquo;William [? Mr. W. H.]&rsquo; (<i>Sonnets</i>, p. 236); but
in my view the poet, in the second line of the sonnet, only seeks emphasis
by repetition in accordance with no uncommon practice of his.&nbsp; The
line &lsquo;And will to boot, and will in over-plus,&rsquo; is paralleled
in its general form and intention in such lines of other sonnets as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind (cv. 5).<br />
Beyond all date, even to eternity (cxxii. 4).<br />
Who art as black as hell, as dark as night (cxlvii. 14).</p>

Dowden, hardly more illuminating, says the lines mean: &lsquo;Love only my
name (something less than loving myself), and then thou lovest me, for my
name is Will, and I myself am all will, <i>i.e.</i> all desire.&rsquo;</p>

pray that the lady may have her Will, <i>i.e.</i> the friend &lsquo;Will [?

Amorous Deuices</i>, 1597 (containing two regular sonnets), by Nicholas
Breton; <i>Alba</i>, <i>the Months Minde of a Melancholy Lover</i>, by
Robert Tofte, 1598; <i>Daiphantus</i>, <i>or the Passions of Love</i>, by

(none of the &lsquo;sonets&rsquo; are in sonnet metre); and John
Reynolds&rsquo;s <i>Dolarnys Primerose</i> . . . <i>wherein is expressed
the liuely passions of Zeale and Loue</i>, 1606.&nbsp; Though George
Wither&rsquo;s similar productions&mdash;his exquisitely fanciful
<i>Fidelia</i> (1617) and his <i>Faire-Virtue</i>, <i>the Mistresse of
Phil&rsquo; Arete</i> (1622)&mdash;were published at a later period, they
were probably designed in the opening years of the seventeenth century.</p>

fourteen like sonnets to his translation of Homer in 1610; they were
increased in later issues to twenty-two.&nbsp; Very numerous sonnets to
patrons were appended by John Davies of Hereford to his <i>Microcosmos</i>
(1603) and to his <i>Scourge of Folly</i> (1611).&nbsp; &lsquo;Divers
sonnets, epistles, &amp;c.&rsquo; addressed to patrons by Joshua Sylvester

sonnet, and it was as popular a poetic form with Italian writers of the
sixteenth century as with those of the three preceding centuries.&nbsp; The
Italian poets whose sonnets, after those of Petrarch, were best known in

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
